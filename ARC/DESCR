ARC -- Assembly by Reduced Complexity

ARC is a pipeline which facilitates iterative, reference-guided de
novo assemblies with the intent of:

- Reducing time in analysis and increasing accuracy of results by only
  considering those reads which should assemble together.

- Reducing/removing reference bias as compared to mapping-based
  approaches.

The software is designed to work in situations where a whole-genome
assembly is not the objective, but rather when the researcher wishes
to assemble discrete 'targets' contained within next-generation
shotgun sequence data. ARC decomplexifies the traditionally difficult
problem of assembly by breaking the reads into small, manageable
subsets which can then be assembled quickly and efficiently in
parallel. Applications include those in which the researcher wishes to
de novo assemble specific content and a set of semi-similar reference
targets is available to initialize the assembly process.
