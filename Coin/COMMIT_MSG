Coin 4.0.3

This is a bugfix release.

- Added support for building modern styled documentation.
- Set minimum C++ standard needed to compile Coin to C++11.
- Fixed LTOcompilation ODR error.
- Fixed suspicious increment in SbProfilingData.cpp.
- Fixed SbTri3f intersect calculation.
- Improved auto clipping.
- Fixed orthographic autoclipping by allowing negative farDistance.
- Fixed rotating a VRMLBackground node with its ancestors' rotations.

Coin 4.0.2

This is a bugfix release.

- ABI compatibility to version 4.0.0 was inadvertently changed and restored.
- Fixed numerous typos found by Codespell.

Coin 4.0.1

This is a bugfix release.

- Introduced COIN_GLX_PIXMAP_DIRECT_RENDERING environment variable to force direct rendering of offscreen contexts.
- Introduced new COIN_DEBUG_CHECK_THREAD option.
- Optimized mutex debugging.
- Fix integer division issue.
- Fix material and normal handling for indexed line set.
- Fix resource lookup when HAVE_MULTIPLE_VERSION is enabled in CMake build script.
- Fixed an transparency issue for indexed lineset.
- Move constant data to read only data segment to reduce size of shared object
  library (see https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/add-a-const-here-delete-a-const-there)
- Fixed numerous issues detected by static code analysis.
- The expat sources under coin/src/xml/expat were updated to version 2.2.10.
- Fix linking with system installation of expat.
- Fix broken ABI version on .so link.
- Do not run programs for determining hash quoting to support cross compiling.
- Fix testing for maximum texture size.
- Removed obsolete ATI driver issue check. Do not check for ATI driver issues
  fixed long time ago (see issue #412). We added environment variable
  COIN_GLGLUE_DISABLE_VBO_IN_DISPLAYLIST for compatibility with the old behaviour.
- Fix underlinking against X11 in CMake build scripts.
- Set GLSL shader version to 120 to avoid rendering issues with fog.
- Enable non power of two textures for ATi and Intel by default. For those who
  are in need of the old behavior, an environment variable
  COIN_GLGLUE_DISABLE_NON_POWER_OF_TWO_TEXTURES has been added.
- Do not disable VBO rendering for Intel graphics drivers anymore. Recent Intel
  graphics hardware is known to properly support VBO rendering. So we remove the
  code for disabling it by default.
- Fix GLX glue trying to use NULL display, i.e. when a unix platform has a
  non-GLX context: usually Wayland, but also might be offscreen or maybe EGL-X11.
- Fix operator arguments on some base types to use const references rather than copies.
- Fixed incorrect rendering of SoFaceSet. Conditions when to render as
  VertexArrayObject were not properly checked.
- Fixed incorrect line ending handling for Windows CR/LF.
- Fixed incorrect closest point calculation for bounding boxes.
- Applied some distribution patches from Fedora, Rosa, and Gentoo.
- Added some class documentation and fixed numerous documentation issues.
- cpack.d was made optional and disabled by default (add -DCOIN_USE_CPACK=ON
  to the cmake commandline to enable it).
- Reference line for text rendered with the built-in default font was changed
  (before: descender line, now: base line). Thus text rendered with default
  font will appear a few pixels lower than before, but now consistent
  with text using non-default fonts.
  (see https://github.com/coin3d/coin/pull/368)
- Fixed crash when call to cc_flww32_get_bitmap() failed.
- Home of Coin3d organization has been changed from https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D
  to https://github.com/coin3d due to Bitbucket ending Mercurial support.
- Version control system has been changed from Mercurial to Git.

Coin 4.0.0

- Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies AS ended Coin as a commercial product
  and re-licensed it under the BSD 3-clause license as a service to the
  user community.
- Build system was migrated from GNU Autotools to CMake.
- Support for UNICODE text added.  Starting with Coin 4.0 strings are UTF-8
  encoded.
- New greater than and less than operators added to SbString.
- New SoReversePerspectiveCamera node added.
  View volume and projectors now support reverse perspective camera settings.
- New getRadius method in SoRayPickAction.
- New virtual method getPickedPointForStart in SoDragger to allow dragging
  of (partially) covered objects by derived draggers.
- New SoAlphaTest node to control alpha test settings.
- New public API for converting geo coordinates created.
- SoTextureCoordinateObject implemented for linear texture functions that
  can be used for projective texture mapping.
- In addition to Cg shaders support for GLSL/ARB shaders was added to
  SoShaderStateMatrixParameter.
- Support for linePatternScaleFactor was added to SoDrawStyle.
- The DISABLE policy is now supported in SoSelection node.
- API in SbMatrix, SoPickAction, SoEvent, SoSFTime, SbPList has changed to
  improve conformance to Open Inventor 2.1 API.

- The expat sources under coin/src/xml/expat were updated to version 2.2.6.
- The local Boost includes under coin/include/Boost were removed and a new
  configure option --with-boost was added to Autotools.
- Support for BitBucket and AppVeyor as continuous integration service providers
  has been added.
