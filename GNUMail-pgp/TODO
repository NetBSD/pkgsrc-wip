- Fix this problem when putting in a passphrase for signing email:
  	"NSRangeException: Range Location + length too great"
  Not sure if this is a NetBSD-specific problem or if it's fixed in the latest 
  version of GNUMail's (1.2.0) PGP bundle, but it's worth looking into. May 
  have something to do with some of the compiler warnings.

- Integrate this package more with GNUMail, i.e. reduce or eliminate Makefile
  duplication between this package and GNUMail, similar to how packages with
  add-on plugins/modules such as libao and Apache work.

- Should versioning be based on GNUMail itself or on this specific bundle?  The
  version of this PGP bundle is 0.7.0 but it's included with the source for
  GNUMail 1.1.2.  I chose the latter for now....
