GraphicsMagick(TM) provides a powerful image manipulation and
translation utility.  It is capable of displaying still images and
animations using the X Window system, provides a simple interface for
interactively editing images, and is capable of importing selected
windows or the entire desktop.  GraphicsMagick can read and write over
88 image formats, including JPEG, TIFF, WMF, SVG, PNG, PNM, GIF, and
Photo CD.  It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add
special effects to the image and save the result to any supported
format.  GraphicsMagick may be used to create animated or transparent
.gifs, create composite images, create thumbnail images, and much,
much, more.

GraphicsMagick is one of your choices if you need a program to
manipulate and display images.  If you want to develop your own
applications which use GraphicsMagick code or APIs, you need to
install GraphicsMagick-devel as well.
