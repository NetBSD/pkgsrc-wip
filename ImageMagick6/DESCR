ImageMagick TM, is a package for display and interactive manipulation
of images for the X Window System.  It is written in C and interfaces
to the X library, and therefore does not require any proprietary
toolkit in order to compile.  Although the software is copyrighted, it
is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.

The ImageMagick image display program can display an image on any
workstation screen running an X server.  It can read and write many of
the more popular image formats including JPEG, TIFF, PNM, GIF, and
Photo CD.  In addition you can interactively resize, rotate, sharpen,
color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your
completed work in the same or differing image format.

This package tracks 6 release branch for backward compatibility.
