Today you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for
the Windows network logon, your e-mail account, your website's FTP
password, online passwords (like website member account), etc. etc.
etc. The list is endless. Also, you should use different passwords
for each account. Because if you use only one password everywhere
and someone gets this password you have a problem... A serious
problem. The thief would have access to your e-mail account, website,
etc. Unimaginable.

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to
manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords
in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file.
So you only have to remember one single master password or select
the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are
encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms
currently known (AES and Twofish).
