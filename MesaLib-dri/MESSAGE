To use this package as a replacement for graphics/MesaLib, simply copy
the replacement buildlink3.mk file in this directory to
${PKGSRCDIR}/graphics/MesaLib/buildlink3.mk.  I hope to soon have the rest
of the MesaLib packages available; in the meantime, you may try appying
the pkgsrc-mesa.diff file here to pkgsrc.  That should enable you to 
build glu, glut, and glx-utils (version 7.0) out-of-the-box 
(this is only for NetBSD, but why would you want this package if you 
weren't running it?).

If you have trouble, please email me at blair.sadewitz@gmail.com and I 
will endeavor to help you.
