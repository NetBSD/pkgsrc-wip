OpenGLUT is an open source evolution of the GLUT API.  The goals
include cleaning the API, fixing bugs, adding features, portability,
and documenting the library.  OpenGLUT is prepared to break with
GLUT compatibility in order to achieve its primary goals.

The code is based on freeglut, with numerous bugfixes above and
beyond that, and a few new features.  As such, it is fairly usable.
On the other hand, there are major features to be added to the API,
and plans to deprecate some obsolete, redundant, and inconsistant
features that OpenGLUT inherited.  It is best to regard OpenGLUT
as experimental, but seeking feedback.  This paragraph should
probably be revisited in the DESCR file around when OpenGLUT 1.0
is released.
