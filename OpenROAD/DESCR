OpenROAD is an integrated chip physical design tool that takes a
design from synthesized Verilog to routed layout.  


An outline of steps used to build a chip using OpenROAD are shown below.

* Initialize floorplan - define the chip size and cell rows
* Place pins (for designs without pads )
* Place macro cells (RAMs, embedded macros)
* Insert substrate tap cells
* Insert power distribution network
* Macro Placement of macro cells
* Global placement of standard cells
* Repair max slew, max capacitance, and max fanout violations and long wires
* Clock tree synthesis
* Optimize setup/hold timing
