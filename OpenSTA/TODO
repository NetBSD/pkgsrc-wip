Following comments from Thomas need to be acted on:

This is not according to pkgsrc standards:
- use ${INSTALL_SCRIPT} instead of the cp and chmod
- executable scripts should not be in etc but in bin or sbin or libexec
- if it really is intended as a modifyable and executable script, it
  should be installed in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/OpenSTA/ and copied
  into ${PKGSYSCONFDIR} with the CONF_FILES mechanics.
