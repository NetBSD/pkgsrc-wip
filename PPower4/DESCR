PPower4 is used to post process presentationen in PDF format which were
prepared using LaTeX to add dynamic effects. The PDF files must have been
created with either pdflatex, vlatex or with standard LaTeX and the converted
to PDF with dvipdfm. It is strongly recommended to use the Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view the results, because other viewers do not implement some
of the special features. For further information see the PPower4 manual.
