PyBabelPhish is a simple Gtk-based frontend for several translation
services available on the web. Through the use of these services,
PyBabelPhish is able to provide full-text translations (full sentences,
phrases, etc.). PyBabelPhish is written in 100% Python, does NOT require
Gnome, but requires Gtk+ and PyGtk. Some languages have been removed from
the list due to an inability to display certain foreign characters
(especially Asian character sets). I am hopeful that support for Asian
languages will be available in the future. PyBabelPhish is in NO way
affiliated with or endorsed by the web-based translation services it
accesses and should NOT be considered 'official' software from these
companies. NO support is provided for PyBabelPhish. This software is free
and open source under the Free Education Initiative License.x
