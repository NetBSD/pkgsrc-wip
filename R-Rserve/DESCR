Rserve is a TCP/IP server which allows other programs to use facilities
of R (see www.r-project.org) from various languages without the need to
initialize R or link against R library. Every connection has a separate
workspace  and  working  directory. Client-side  implementations  are
available for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java. Rserve supports
remote connection, authentication and file transfer. Typical use is to
integrate R backend for computation of statstical models, plots etc. in
other applications.
