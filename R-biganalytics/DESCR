This package extends the bigmemory package with various analytics.
Functions bigkmeans and binit may also be used with native R objects.
For tapply-like functions, the bigtabulate package may also be
helpful.  For linear algebra support, see bigalgebra. For mutex
(locking) support for advanced shared-memory usage, see synchronicity.
