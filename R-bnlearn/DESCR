Bayesian network structure learning (via constraint-based, score-based
and hybrid algorithms), parameter learning (via ML and Bayesian
estimators) and inference.

This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental
Association (IAMB) algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB)
algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents
and Children (MMPC) algorithm, the Hiton-PC algorithm, the ARACNE
and Chow-Liu algorithms, the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search
algorithm, the Tabu Search (TABU) algorithm, the Max-Min Hill-Climbing
(MMHC) algorithm and the two-stage Restricted Maximization (RSMAX2)
algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with many
score functions and conditional independence tests. The Naive Bayes
and the Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers are also
implemented.

Some utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random
data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced plots)
are included, as well as support for parameter estimation and
inference, conditional probability queries and cross-validation.
