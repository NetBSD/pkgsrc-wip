Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
data. This package provides access to many of those services and
returns elevation data either as an 'sf' simple features object from
point elevation services or as a 'raster' object from raster elevation
services. In future versions, 'elevatr' will drop support for 'raster'
and will instead return 'terra' objects. Currently, the package
supports access to the Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles
<https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/>, the Open Topography
Global Datasets API <https://opentopography.org/developers/>, and the
USGS Elevation Point Query Service
<https://apps.nationalmap.gov/epqs/>.
