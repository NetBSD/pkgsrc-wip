R implementation of various estimators of entropy, such as the
shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum likelihood
and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and
the Chao-Shen estimator. It also offers an R interface to the NSB
estimator. Furthermore, it provides functions for estimating
Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi2-squared, mutual information, and
chi2-squared statistic of independence. In addition there are
functions for discretizing continuous random variables.
