Extends the fitdistr() function (of the MASS package) with several
functions to help the fit of a parametric distribution to non-censored
or censored data. Censored data may contain left censored, right
censored and interval censored values, with several lower and upper
bounds. In addition to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the
package provides moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME) and
maximum goodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) methods (available only
for non-censored data). Weighted versions of MLE, MME and QME are
available. See e.g. Casella & Berger (2002). Statistical inference.
