It contains functions that solve least squares linear regression
problems under linear equality/inequality constraints. Functions
for solving quadratic programming problems are also available, which
transform such problems into least squares ones first. It is developed
based on the 'Fortran' program of Lawson and Hanson (1974, 1995),
which is public domain and available at
