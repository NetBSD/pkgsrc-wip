Import xyz data from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, <https://www.noaa.gov>), GEBCO (General Bathymetric
Chart of the Oceans, <https://www.gebco.net>) and other sources, plot
xyz data to prepare publication-ready figures, analyze xyz data to
extract transects, get depth / altitude based on geographical
coordinates, or calculate z-constrained least-cost paths.
