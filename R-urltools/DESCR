A toolkit for all URL-handling needs, including encoding and decoding,
parsing, parameter extraction and modification. All functions are
designed to be both fast and entirely vectorised. It is intended to be
useful for people dealing with web-related datasets, such as
server-side logs, although may be useful for other situations
involving large sets of URLs.
