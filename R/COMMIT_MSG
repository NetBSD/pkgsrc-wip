(math/R) Updated 4.4.2 to 4.4.3

CHANGES IN R 4.4.3:

  INSTALLATION:

         * R can be installed using C23 (for example with '-std=gnu23'
           or '-std=gnu2x') with recent compilers including 'gcc'
           12-14, Apple 'clang' 15-16, LLVM 'clang' 17-20 and Intel
           'icx' 2024.2.

           It can be installed with the upcoming (at the time of
           writing) 'gcc' 15, which defaults to C23.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

         * The functions 'R_strtod' and 'R_atof' now allow hexadecimal
           constants without an exponent, for compatibility with their
           C99 versions (PR#18805).

  UTILITIES:

         * 'R CMD build' and 'R CMD check' now allow reference output
           for demo scripts ('demo/<demo>.Rout.save' files) to be
           shipped with the package, as proposed by Torsten Hothorn in
           PR#18816.

  BUG FIXES:

         * 'kappa(A, exact=TRUE)' for singular 'A' returns 'Inf' more
           generally, fixing PR#18817 reported by Mikael Jagan.

         * Fixed URLs of the sun spots ('sunspot.month' etc) data sets
           and mention future changes due to recalibration.

         * The parser now accepts hexadecimal constants with a decimal
           point without an exponent (taken as 'p0') as documented in
           '?NumericConstants' (PR#18819).

         * 'rbind()' now works correctly when inputs include a raw
           vector and a logical, integer or double vector - previously
           the inclusion of the latter was garbled.

         * 'smooth.spline()' checks validity of its arguments
           'df.offset' and 'penalty': it could segfault if they were
           'NULL'.

         * 'isGeneric(<primitive>, fdef=*, getName=TRUE)' now also
           returns the name instead of just 'TRUE', fixing PR#18829
           reported by Mikael Jagan.

         * 'isGeneric(fdef = print)' now works, fixing PR#18369 thanks
           to Mikael Jagan.

         * 'sort(x, method = "qsort")' made illegal accesses when 'x'
           has length 0.

         * 'dir.create()' is protected against being passed an empty
           string as its 'path' argument.

         * Silent integer overflow could occur in the 'exact'
           computations for 'fisher.test()' for unrealistic inputs:
           this is now an error.

         * Some invalid C-level memory accesses are avoided for
           'loglin(, margin = NULL)'.

           'loglin(, param = TRUE)' no longer gives an error in corner
           cases such as a one-dimensional input.

         * 'dev.capabilities() $ events' now reports '"Idle"' if the
           device provides it, fixing PR#18836, thanks to Trevor Davis.

         * 'arima(.., seasonal = <wrong-vector>)' correctly errors now,
           ditto for 'arima0()', thanks to Norbert Kuder's report on
           the R-devel list.

         * 'binomial(<link>)$linkinv(eta)' and '.. $mu.eta(eta)' now
           also work for '"logit"' link when 'is.integer(eta)'.

         * 'as.roman(x)' now should work platform independently, also
           for, e.g., 'x = "IIIII"' (= V) and 'x = "IIIIII"' (= VI).

         * 'R CMD Rd2pdf' works again on an installed package directory
           containing LaTeX help (from option '--latex'), thanks to a
           report by Peter Ruckdeschel.
