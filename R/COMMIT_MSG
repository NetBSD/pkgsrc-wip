(math/R) Updated 4.3.2 to 4.3.3

CHANGES IN R 4.3.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

         * 'iconv()' now fixes up variant encoding names such as
           '"utf8"' case-insensitively.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

         * The legacy 'encoding = "MacRoman"' is deprecated in 'pdf()'
           and 'postscript()': support was incomplete in earlier
           versions of R.

  BUG FIXES:

         * Arguments are now properly forwarded to methods on S4
           generics with ... in the middle of their formal arguments.
           This was broken for the case when a method introduced an
           argument but did not include ... in its own formals. Thanks
           to Herv<c3><a9> Pag<c3><a8>s for the report PR#18538.

         * Some invalid 'file' arguments to 'pictex()', 'postscript()'
           and 'xfig()' opened a file called 'NA' rather than throw an
           error.  These included 'postscript(NULL)' (which some people
           expected to work like 'pdf(NULL)').

         * Passing 'filename = NA' to 'svg()', 'cairo_pdf()',
           'cairo_ps()' or the Cairo-based bitmap devices opened a file
           called 'NA': it now throws an error.

         * 'quartz(file = NA)' opened a file called 'NA', including
           when used as a Quartz-based bitmap device.  It now gives an
           error.

         * 'rank(<long vector>)' now works, fixing PR#18617, thanks to
           Ilia Kats.

         * 'seq.int()' did not adequately check its 'length.out'
           argument.

         * 'match(<POSIXct>, .)' is correct again for differing time
           zones, ditto for '"POSIXlt"', fixing PR#18618 reported by
           Bastian Klein.

         * 'drop.terms(*, dropx = <0-length>)' now works, fixing
           PR#18563 as proposed by Mikael Jagan.

         * 'drop.terms(*)' keeps ' + offset(.)' terms when it should,
           PR#18565, and 'drop.terms()' no longer makes up a response,
           PR#18566, fixing both bugs thanks to Mikael Jagan.

         * 'getS3method("t", "test")' no longer finds the 't.test()'
           function, fixing PR#18627.

         * 'pdf()' and 'postscript()' support for the documented Adobe
           encodings '"Greek"' and '"Cyrilllic"' was missing (although
           the corresponding Windows' codepages could be used).

         * Computations of glyph metric information for 'pdf()' and
           'postscript()' did not take into account that
           transliteration could replace one character by two or more
           (only seen on macOS 14) and typically warned that the
           information was not known.

         * 'rank(x)' no longer overflows during integer addition, when
           computing rank average for largish but not-yet long vector
           'x', fixing PR#18630, thanks to Ilia Kats.

         * 'list.files()' on Windows now returns also files with names
           longer that 260 bytes (the Windows limit is 260 characters).
           Previously, some file names particularly with 'East Asian'
           characters were omitted.

         * 'cov2cor(<0 x 0>)' now works, fixing PR#18423 thanks to
           Mikael Jagan and Elin Waring.

         * 'cov2cor(<negative diagonal>)' and similar now give one
           warning instead of two, with better wording, fixing PR#18424
           thanks to Mikael Jagan.

         * 'tools'':: startDynamicHelp()' now ensures 'port' is in
           proper range, fixing PR#18645.

         * 'pbeta(x, a,b)' is correct now for 'x'=0 or 1 in the
           boundary cases where 'a' or 'b' or both are 0, fixing
           PR#18672 thanks to Michael Fay.

         * 'pmatch(x, table)' for large 'table', also called for data
           frame row selection, 'dfrm[nm, ]', is now interruptible,
           fixing PR#18656.

         * 'predict(<rank-deficient lm>, newdata=*)' fix computing of
           'nbasis', see Russ Lenth's comment 29 in PR#16158.

         * Added a work-around for a bug in macOS 14.3.1 and higher
           which prevents R plots in the Quartz Cocoa device from
           updating on screen.
