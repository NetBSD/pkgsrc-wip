On NetBSD/amd64 9.3: I have Following configure problem:

=> Checking for portability problems in extracted files

*** Error code 2

Chat memo for above problem:

20:06 < mef> Newly updated (by myself, sorry) math/R 4.4.3 has problem on 9.3 with_blas variable related probably
20:07 < mef> m4 version and blas version is the same
20:07 < mef> (10.99.12 and 9.3, both amd64)

20:08 < mef> generated configure is a little bit different
20:08 < mef> autoconf are the same version as well

20:12 < mef> on 10.99.12  (OK)
20:12 < mef>    4767 # Check whether --with-blas was given.
20:12 < mef>    4768 if test ${with_blas+y}
20:12 < mef>    4769 then :
20:12 < mef>    4770   withval=$with_blas; if test "${withval}" = no; then
20:12 < mef>    4771   use_blas=no
20:12 < mef>    4772 else
20:12 < mef>    4773   use_blas=yes
20:12 < mef>    4774 fi

20:13 < mef> 0n 9.3   (BAD)
20:13 < mef>    4389 # Check whether --with-blas was given.
20:13 < mef>    4390 if test ${with_blas+y}
20:13 < mef>    4391 then :
20:13 < mef>    4392   withval=$with_blas; R_ARG_USE(blas)
20:13 < mef>    4393 else case e in #(
20:13 < mef>    4394   e) use_blas=unset ;;
20:13 < mef>    4395 esac
20:13 < mef>    4396 fi
20:15 < mef>  blas version are the same


20:15 < mef> --- R_ARG_USE(blas) ---
20:15 < mef> part is differenet

20:12 < mef>    4770   withval=$with_blas; if test "${withval}" = no; then
20:13 < mef>    4392   withval=$with_blas; R_ARG_USE(blas)

20:19 < mef> I'll put new R-4.4.3 under wip, and revert math side ;-(

The problem may not depend on Release, but may be by just my hosts setup,
not checked that point.
