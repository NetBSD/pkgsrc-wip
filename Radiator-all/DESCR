Radiator is a highly configurable and flexible Radius server that supports
authentication by a huge range of methods. This package provides some
useful Perl modules to assist Radiator.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the package dependency
mechanism.
