Mull over what to do about the GUI functionality in the test script, i.e.
 1. whether to leave it as is and let the user decide whether to install
     p5-Tk
 2. whether to make a separate package for a GUI test script
 3. or whether to make this package depend on p5-Tk.
                                                                                
(1 or 2 are probably what will happen.)
                                                                                
Also need to add an rc.d script and see what to do about PKG_SYSCONFDIR.
