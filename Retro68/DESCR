Retro68
=======

A GCC-based cross-compilation environment for 68K and PowerPC Macs.
Why? Because there is no decent C++17 Compiler targeting Apple's System 6.
If that's not a sufficient reason for you, I'm sure you will find
something more useful elsewhere.

If you are crazy enough to try it out, please say hello at
wolfgang.thaller@gmx.net.
