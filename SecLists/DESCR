SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of
multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in
one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data
patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to
enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box
and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
