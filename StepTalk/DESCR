StepTalk is the official GNUstep scripting framework. StepTalk is more than a
scripting framework with an illusion of single objective environment between
objects of scriptable servers or applications. StepTalk, when combined with
the dynamism that the Objective-C language provides, goes way beyond mere
scripting. It is language independent - it uses languages as separate bundles.
