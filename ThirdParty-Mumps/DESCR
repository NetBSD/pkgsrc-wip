# ThirdParty-Mumps

This is an autotools-based build system to build and install
[MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver](http://mumps-solver.org/) (MUMPS).
This installation of MUMPS is used by some other COIN-OR projects.

This version of ThirdParty-Mumps retrieves and builds MUMPS 5.7.1.

## Dependencies

- MUMPS source requires a Fortran 90 compiler.

- MUMPS requires LAPACK to be available. `configure` will look for a Lapack
  installation, but if that does not succeed, the flags to link with Lapack
  should be specified with the `--with-lapack-lflags` argument of `configure`.

- MUMPS can make use of METIS. `configure` will look for a METIS library and
  header, but if that does not succeed, the arguments `--with-metis-lflags`
  and `--with-metis-cflags` can be specified for `configure`.
