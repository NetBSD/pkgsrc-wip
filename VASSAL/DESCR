Vassal is a game engine for building and playing online adaptations
of board games and card games. You can use Vassal to play in real
time over the Internet or by email. Vassal runs on all platforms,
and is free, open-source software.

Hundreds of boardgames have been converted for use with Vassal, so
there's a good chance that you'll find the games you own in our
module library already. If there is not yet a Vassal module for
your favorite game, you can use the Vassal Editor to build your
own module, and should you run into trouble, help is only a click
away in our forum.
