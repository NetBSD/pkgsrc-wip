 1 - WeakIVGen.pl - This script allows a simple emulation of IV/encrypted
     output that one might observe with a WEP enable 802.11 Access Point.
     The script generates IV combinations that can weaken the secret key
     used to encrypt the WEP traffic

 2 - prism-getIV.pl - This script relies on output from Prismdump [or from
     Ethereal captures if libpcap has been patched for 802.11 monitor mode],
     and looks for IVs that match the pattern known to weakned secret keys.
     This script also captures the 1st byte of the encrypted output and
     places it and the weak IVs in a logfile.

 3 - WEPCrack.pl - This script uses data collected or generated by WeakIVGen
     to attempt to determine the secret key. It will work with either 40bit
     or 128bit WEP.

Additionaly, I have included a script prism-decode.pl that will decode most
802.11 frame types. This tool is intended to be used with prismdump, but
could also be used against Ethereal 802.11 saved captures. It might be useful
for capturing SSIDs, AP MAC addresses, or authentication data.
