Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a full implementation of
the Common Lisp language featuring both an interpreter and
a compiler, running in the JVM. Originally started to be
a scripting language for the J editor, it now supports JSR-223
(Java scripting API): it can be a scripting engine in any Java
application. Additionally, it can be used to implement (parts of)
the application using Java to Lisp integration APIs.
