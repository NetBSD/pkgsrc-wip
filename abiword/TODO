- Write an options.mk file FIXED!
- Test package on main platforms
- Write a CONFLICT with abiword-plugins (or not?)
- dependecies are missing for some plugins
  the wordperfect plugin need libwpd-stream Fixed!
  mathview plugin needs gtkmathview Fixed!
  inter7eps needs http://www.inter7.com/eps-email-processor Fixed!

- one patch in editors/abiword mentions that gcc 4.6+ chokes on 
  -no-undefined and needs -Wl, well -no-undefined is now in every plugin
  Makefile so they will need patching as well I guess. Fixed!

- On NetBSD UCS-4 (UTF-32) is not converted correctly the first time 
  rulers are painted. On repaint they are displayed correctly.
