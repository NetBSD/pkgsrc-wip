This is ACID which is basically a PHP-based analysis engine to search and 
process a database of security events generated by various IDSes, firewalls, 
and network monitoring tools.  It's mainly used for snort when logging to mySQL
databases.

This requires a few packages which are not in the main pkgsrc tree but are in
pkgsrc/wip.  Specifically adodb and jpgraph will be pulled in when you install
this package.

You can also specify postgresql or mysql database support. See package
Makefile for details.

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Ta,

Adrian.
