ACPID used to try to handle events internally.  Rather than try to climb
an ever-growing mountain, ACPID now lets YOU define what events to handle.
Any event that publishes itself to /proc/acpi/event can be handled.

ACPID reads a set of configuration files which define event->action pairs.
This is how you make it do stuff. See the man page for details.
