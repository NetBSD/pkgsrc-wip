AdvanceMAME is an unofficial port of the arcade game emulator MAME
0.106 and multi-system emulator MESS 0.106 for Arcade Monitors and
TVs but also for LCDs and PC monitors.

The main difference compared with the official emulators is that
the Advance versions are able to program directly the video board
to always get a video mode with the correct size and frequency.

Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which
doesn't require any stretching or other unneeded effects to match
the original arcade display.
