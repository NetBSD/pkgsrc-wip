AirConnect is a collection of programs that allow AirPlay clients to
play to UPnP/DLNA and Chromecast devices that do not natively
support AirPlay.

It includes:

- airupnp: Bridge between AirPlay and UPnP/DLNA/Sonos players
- aircast: Bridge between AirPlay and Chromecast devices

AirConnect can run on any machine that has access to your local network.
It does not need to be on your main computer. (For example, a Raspberry
Pi works well). It will detect UPnP/Sonos/Chromecast players, create as
many virtual AirPlay devices as needed, and act as a bridge/proxy
between AirPlay clients (iPhone, iPad, iTunes, MacOS, AirFoil ...) and
the real UPnP/Sonos/Chromecast players.
