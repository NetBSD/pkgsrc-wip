ait is small yet mighty GNU Emacs style editor. It is inspired by GNU
Emacs, microEMACS, Plan 9's acme, mle, OpenBSD's mle, and
vi/vim/neovim. ait uses termbox2 giving it great portability across
most unix-like systems. Think of ait as microEMACS but with
traditional Emacs keybindings and some advanced features from the
editors mentioned above.

Some of ait's features are:
- Emacs-like keybindings
- basic window/buffer support
- isearch
- find/replace
- M-x to run shell commands
- M-o to open files with external command
- basic unlimited undo/redo
- keyboard macros
- jump/zap to char
- bracket highlighting
- syntax highlighting for strings and comments
- quick jump to line and word
- UTF-8/Unicode Support
