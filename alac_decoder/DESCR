Located here is a basic decoder for Apple Lossless Audio Codec
files (ALAC). ALAC is a proprietary lossless audio compression
scheme. Apple never released any documents on the format.  What I
provide here is a C implementation of a decoder, written from
reverse engineering the file format. It turns out that most of the
algorithms in the codec are fairly well known. ALAC uses an adaptive
FIR prediction algorithm and stores the error values using a modified
rice or golumb algorithm. Further details are in alac.c.
