Alive is an auto-login client and connection keeper for Telia AB ADSL
and Comhem broadband. It automatically logs in at system startup and
then "forks" a daemon that pings and logs into the login host after a
chosen delay. Alive is a continuation of the qadsl project.  
The pkgsrc patch enables the use of environment settings "http_proxy"
and "no_proxy".
