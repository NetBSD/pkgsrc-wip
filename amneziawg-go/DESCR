AmneziaWG is a contemporary version of the WireGuard protocol. It's a
fork of WireGuard-Go and offers protection against detection by Deep
Packet Inspection (DPI) systems. At the same time, it retains the
simplified architecture and high performance of the original.

The precursor, WireGuard, is known for its efficiency but had issues
with detection due to its distinctive packet signatures. AmneziaWG
addresses this problem by employing advanced obfuscation methods,
allowing its traffic to blend seamlessly with regular internet traffic.
As a result, AmneziaWG maintains high performance while adding an extra
layer of stealth, making it a superb choice for those seeking a fast and
discreet VPN connection.
