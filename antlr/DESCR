ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
C++ or Java actions.

NOTE: This version is not maintained upstream anymore and newer versions aren't
backward compatible. Hence some dependent packages require keeping this alive.
