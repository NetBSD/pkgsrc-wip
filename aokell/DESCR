AOKell is a Java implementation of the Fractal component model which uses
Aspect-Oriented Programming. The goal of AOKell is to provide some high level
mechanisms for implementing the control semantics of a Fractal component.

The two main contributions of AOKell are to provide:

* an aspect-oriented solution for gluing the control part of a
  Fractal component with its content,
* a component-based solution for implementing the control part of
   a Fractal component.

AOKell is then a framework where the notions of a component, an interface, and a
binding are used both to implement the business part of an application and its
control semantics. The novelty is thus to provide a component-based
engineering of  control.This control part is then  glued to the content
using either AspectJ aspects or Spoon processors.
