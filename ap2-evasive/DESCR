mod_evasive is an evasive maneuvers module for Apache to provide evasive action
in the event of an HTTP DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also
designed to be a detection and network management tool, and can be easily
configured to talk to ipchains, firewalls, routers, and etcetera. mod_evasive
presently reports abuses via email and syslog facilities.

Detection is performed by creating an internal dynamic hash table of IP
Addresses and URIs, and denying any single IP address from any of the
following:

    * Requesting the same page more than a few times per second
    * Making more than 50 concurrent requests on the same child per second
    * Making any requests while temporarily blacklisted (on a blocking list)

This package is for use with apache version 2.
