This module allows and Apache 2.0 web server to register its services on a
Zero Configuration network.

Zeroconf <http://www.zeroconf.org/> is a working group of the IETF. The
charter of this working group is to have computers network using TCP/IP
without prior configuration: no address servers or name servers are needed.
Zeroconf consists of the following protocols:

*  Link-local IP addressing, where hosts pick a random address in the
   169.254/16 range.
*  Multicast DNS or mDNS, where every host runs its own DNS responder that
   listens on port 5353 and communicates over multicast UDP/IP address
   224.0.0.251 (IPv6 equivalent ff02::fb). All hosts are collectively
   authorative for the .local. domain.
*  DNS Service Discovery or DNS-SD allows hosts and their user to register and
   browse services by a human-readable name.

mod_zeroconf relies on an external mDNS Responder and currently supports
net/howl.
