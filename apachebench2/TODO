 -- This _does_ build on FreeBSD-4-STABLE

This doesn't build.
 -- propably NetBSD-current or NetBSD-stable... ?
 
In file included from ab.c:174:
/usr/pkg/include/apr-0/apr_poll.h:109: redefinition of `apr_pollfd_t'
/usr/pkg/include/apr_network_io.h:188: `apr_pollfd_t' previously declared here

This could use devel/apr but I don't to have an dependency, because
using --enable-static-ab.

Or get this to use apr and apr-util included in this source.

I want this to support ipv6 and HTTPS.

Feel free to work on this.
