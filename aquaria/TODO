- Need to come up with a suitable PLIST, despite that there is no "install"
  target. Fortunately, users can set the AQUARIA_DATA_PATH environment var
  to pretty much whatever they want, including wherever we decide to install
  that data (probably ${PREFIX}/share/aquaria/data). 

- Need to build a MESSAGE which describes what you need to do/buy in order
  to actually play the game.
