This project brings support for the ESP8266 chip to the Arduino environment. It
lets you write sketches, using familiar Arduino functions and libraries, and run
them directly on ESP8266, with no external microcontroller required.

ESP8266 Arduino core comes with libraries to communicate over WiFi using TCP and
UDP, set up HTTP, mDNS, SSDP, and DNS servers, do OTA updates, use a file system
in flash memory, and work with SD cards, servos, SPI and I2C peripherals.
