ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available
as Open Source. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for
scanners, cameras and film recorders, and calibration and profiling
of displays and RGB & CMYK printers. Device Link can be created
with a wide variety of advanced options, including specialized
Video calibration standards and 3dLuts. Spectral sample data is
supported, allowing a selection of illuminants observer types, and
paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation. Profiles can also
incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual and
saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the
CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and
a wide selection of rendering intents. It also includes code for
the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available
anywhere, as well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit
conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed and compared
with a modern Web browser using X3DOM . Comprehensive documentation
is provided for each major tool, and a general guide to using the
tools for typical color management tasks is also available. A
mailing list provides support for more advanced usage.
