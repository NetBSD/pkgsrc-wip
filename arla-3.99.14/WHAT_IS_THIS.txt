Since NetBSD 3.99.14 when the ktrace-lwp branch was merged with HEAD, the
lkm-part of Arla broke and would not compile.

This is an attempt to adapt the Arla package to work with NetBSD 3.99.14
and beyond. If everything works out with this package, I will send-pr fixes
to have these patches included in pkgsrc/net/arla within a near future!

Please report any errors or problems to ola<-at->mreriksson.net!
