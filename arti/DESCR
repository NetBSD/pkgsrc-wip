Arti is a project to produce an embeddable, production-quality implementation
of the Tor anonymity protocols in the Rust programming language.

Arti is more flexible than the C tor implementation. Unlike the C tor, which
was designed as SOCKS proxy originally, and whose integration features were
later "bolted on", Arti is designed from the ground up to work as a modular,
embeddable library that other applications can use.

Current Status
Arti can connect to the Tor network, bootstrap a view of the Tor directory,
and make anonymized connections over the network. Now that Arti has reached
version 1.0.0, we believe it is suitable for actual use to anonymise
connections.

There are a number of areas (especially at the lower layers) where APIs
(especially internal APIs) are not stable, and are likely to change them.
Right now that includes the command line interface to the arti program.

And of course it's still very new so there are likely to be bugs.
