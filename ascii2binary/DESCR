The Ascii2Binary project consists of two complementary programs that
convert between textual and binary representations of numbers.
Ascii2Binary reads input consisting of textual representations of
numbers separated by whitespace and produces as output the binary
equivalents. It is useful for generating test data and linking
programs that generate textual output to programs that require binary
input. Binary2Ascii converts binary numbers to text. In both programs,
the type and size/precision of the input or output is selected using
command line flags.
