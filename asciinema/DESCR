asciinema (aka asciinema CLI or asciinema recorder) is a command-line
tool for recording and live streaming terminal sessions.

Unlike typical screen recording software, which records visual output
of a screen into a heavyweight video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`), asciinema
CLI runs inside a terminal, capturing terminal session output into a
lightweight recording files in the asciicast format (`.cast`), or
streaming it live to viewers in real-time.

The recordings can be replayed in a terminal, embedded on a web page
with the asciinema player, or published to an asciinema server, such as
asciinema.org, for further sharing. Live streams allow viewers to watch
terminal sessions as they happen.
