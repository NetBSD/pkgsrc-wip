asm-lsp is a language server for NASM/GAS/Go Assembly.

asm-lsp provides hovering, autocompletion, signature help, go to
definition, and view references for assembly files written in the
GAS/NASM or GO assembly flavors. It supports assembly files for the
x86, x86_64, ARM, RISCV, and z80 instruction sets.

This tool can serve as reference when reading the assembly output of a
program. This way you can query what each command exactly does and
deliberate about whether the compiler is producing the desired output
or whether you have to tweak your code for optimisation.
