  error: found a virtual manifest at `.../pkgsrc/wip/ast-grep/work/ast-grep-0.11.1/Cargo.toml` instead of a package manifest

  A custom `do-install:' target is added to workaround that. It would be nice if
  default installation do the right thing without any custom do-install:.

- Should we install both `sg' and `ast-grep'? Maybe just `sg' is enough?
