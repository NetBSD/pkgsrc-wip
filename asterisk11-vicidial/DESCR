Asterisk is a complete PBX in software.  It provides all of the
features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice
over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all
standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive
hardware.

VICIDIAL is a software suite that is designed to interact with
the Asterisk Open-Source PBX Phone system to act as a complete
inbound/outbound contact center suite with inbound email support
as well.

This is a modified version of Asterisk 11 for Vicidial.
