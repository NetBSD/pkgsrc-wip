$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.0 2017/06/15 $

There are some perl scripts you might want to run to populate the MySQL
database, which is neccesary to use this GUI client for asterisk.

Please check the steps needed to properly configure astGUIclient in:
${WRKSRC}/docs/SCRATCH_INSTALL.txt or
${WRKSRC}/docs/BASE_INSTALL.txt (summarized).

You should install the Asterisk version supported for this vicidial
package to work properly:
	> wip/asterisk-vicidial

It also contains optional dependencies you might want to check.
Most of them are included in the options of this package.
