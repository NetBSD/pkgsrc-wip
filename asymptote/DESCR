Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that provides a
natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing. Labels and equations
are typeset with LaTeX, for high-quality PostScript output. A major advantage of
Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a programming language, as
opposed to just a graphics program. Features of Asymptote:

# provides a portable standard for typesetting mathematical figures,
just as TeX/LaTeX has become the standard for typesetting equations;

# generates and embeds 3D vector PRC graphics into PDF files;

# inspired by MetaPost, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like
programming syntax and floating-point numerics;

# runs on all major platforms (UNIX, MacOS, Microsoft Windows);

# mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication);

# LaTeX typesetting of labels (for document consistency);

# uses simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size
constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads)
and objects that should scale with figure size;
  ...and more!
