The atac-seq meta-package provides the core tools needed for
performing a typical ATAC-Seq differential accessibility analysis,
including adapter trimming, quality control, alignment, peak calling,
and identification of differentially accessible peaks.  Researchers
may want additional tools for data manipulation, gene ontology,
etc.
