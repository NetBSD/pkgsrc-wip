To use the driver you will need to:

(1) Add at least a device section to your XF86Config similar to the
    example in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/${PKGBASE}/XF86Config.example
    Please be sure to add ${PREFIX}/lib/modules to your ModulePath.

(2) Symlink ${PREFIX}/etc/ati to /etc/ati.  Failure to do so will result
    in a watermark on the lower-right part of the screen saying
    `Testing use only' and `Unsupported hardware'.

Note: some machines may require using `initati' from wip/ati-xfree86-bin-init
to work-around an initialization issue that may lead to a complete hang.
