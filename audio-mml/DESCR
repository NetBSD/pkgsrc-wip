Rat allows users to conduct host-to-host or multihost audio
teleconferences over an internet.

This package contains development sources.  The build has
been modified to install a libtool library (of the code normally
built only into "convenience" libraries) and headers.  I did this
mostly as a convience for myself and others wishing to use this
for NetBSD audio in other applications.
