autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a new
program which follows the GNU programming standards. The new package uses
autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the Makefile.
The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a new
project. It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory and populate
it with standard files, customized for the new project. Optionally, the new
package will use an external command line parser or a parser generator.
