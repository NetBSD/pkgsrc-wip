autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it
as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic.
o The idea is from rstunnel (Reliable SSH Tunnel), but implemented in C.
o The author's view is that it is not as fiddly as rstunnel to get
  to work.
o Connection monitoring using a loop of port forwardings or a remote
  echo service.
o Backs off on rate of connection attempts when experiencing rapid
  failures such as connection refused.
