Avida is an auto-adaptive genetic system designed
primarily for use as a platform in Digital or
Artificial Life research. In lay terms, Avida is
a digital world in which simple computer programs
mutate and evolve.  Avida allows us to study questions
and perform experiments in evolutionalry dynamics
and theoretical biology that are intractable in real
biological system.
