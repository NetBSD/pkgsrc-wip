Changes for AVR architecture in GCC 15
======================================
- Support has been added for the signal(num) and interrupt(num) function
  attributes that allow to specify the interrupt vector number num as an
  argument. It allows to use static functions as interrupt handlers, and
  also functions defined in a C++ namespace.
- Support has been added for the noblock function attribute. It can be
  specified together with the signal attribute to indicate that the
  interrupt service routine should start with a SEI instruction to
  globally re-enable interrupts. The difference to the interrupt
  attribute is that the noblock attribute just acts like a flag and does
  not impose a specific function name.
- Support has been added for the __builtin_avr_mask1 built-in function.
  It can be used to compute some bit masks when code like 1 << offset is
  not fast enough.
- Support has been added for a new 24-bit named address space __flashx.
  It is similar to the __memx address space introduced in GCC 4.7,
  but reading is more efficient since it only supports reading from
  program memory. Objects in the __flashx address space are located
  in the .progmemx.data section. The address space is available when
  the feature-test macro __FLASHX is defined.
- Apart from the built-in types __int24 and __uint24 supported since
  GCC 4.7, support has been added for the signed __int24 and
  unsigned __int24 types.
- Code generation for the 32-bit integer shifts with constant offset
  has been improved. The code size may slightly increase even when
  optimizing for code size with -Os.
- Support has been added for a compact vector table as supported by
  some AVR devices. It can be activated by the new command-line
  option -mcvt. It links crtmcu-cvt.o as startup code which is supported
  since AVR-LibC v2.3.
- Support has been added for the new option -mno-call-main. Instead of
  calling main, it will be located in section .init9.
- New AVR specific optimizations have been added. They can be controlled
  by the new command-line options -mfuse-move, -msplit-ldst,
  -msplit-bit-shift and -muse-nonzero-bits.
- Support for the following devices has been added:
  AVR32DA28S, AVR32DA32S, AVR32DA48S, AVR64DA28S, AVR64DA32S,
  AVR64DA48S, AVR64DA64S, AVR128DA28S, AVR128DA32S, AVR128DA48S,
  AVR128DA64S.

Changes for AVR architecture in GCC 14
======================================
- On AVR64* and AVR128* devices, read-only data is now located in
  program memory per default and no longer in RAM.
  - Only a 32Â KiB block of program memory can be used to store and
    access .rodata in that way. Which block is used can be selected by
    defining the symbol __flmap. As an alternative, the byte address of
    the block can be specified by the symbol __RODATA_FLASH_START__
    which takes precedence over __flmap. For example, linking with
    -Wl,--defsym,__RODATA_FLASH_START__=32k chooses the second 32Â KiB
    block.
  - The default uses the last 32 KiB block, which is also the hardware
    default for bit-field NVMCTRL_CTRLB.FLMAP.
  - When a non-default block is used, then NVMCTRL_CTRLB.FLMAP must be
    initialized accordingly by hand, or AVR-LibC v2.2 that implements
    #931 can be used. The latter initializes NVMCTRL_CTRLB.FLMAP in the
    startup code and according to the value ofÂ __flmap or
    __RODATA_FLASH_START__.
  - When AVR-LibC with #931 is used, then defining the symbol
    __flmap_lock to a non-zero value will set bit
    NVMCTRL_CTRLB.FLMAPLOCK. This will protect NVMCTRL_CTRLB.FLMAP from
    any further changes which would be Undefined Behaviour in C/C++.
    If you prefer to define the symbol in a C/C++ file, an asm statement
    can be used:
        __asm (".global __flmap_lock"  "\n\t"
               "__flmap_lock = 1");
  - When you do not want the code from #931, then define a global symbol
    __do_flmap_init and the linker will not pull in that code from
   libmcu.a any more.
  - In order to return to the old placement of read-only data in RAM,
    the new compiler option -mrodata-in-ram can be used. This is
    required on devices where the hardware revision is affected by a
    silicon bug concerning the FLMAP functionality.
  - Read-only data is located in output section .rodata, whereas it is
    part of .text when located in RAM.
  - The feature is only available when the compiler is configured with a
    version of Binutils that implements PR31124, which is the case for
    Binutils v2.42 and up.
  - The implementation consists of two parts: 
        1. Binutils support new emulations avrxmega2_flmap and
           avrxmega4_flmap. The sole purpose of these emulations is to
           provide adjusted default linker description files. Apart from
           that, these emulations behave exactly the same like avrxmega2
           resp. avrxmega4.
        2. The compiler uses a device-specs file which links the program
           with -mavrxmega2_flmap or -mavrxmega2 depending on
           -m[no-]rodata-in-ram; and similar for -mavrxmega4[_flmap].
    This means the feature can be used with older compiler or Binutils
    versions; all what's needed is an adjusted linker script and a custom
    device-specs file.
- A new compiler option -m[no-]rodata-in-ram has been added. The default
  is to locate read-only data in program memory for devices that support
  it, e.g. for AVR64* and AVR128* devices as explained above, and for
  devices from the avrxmega3 and avrtiny families. 
- The new built-in macro __AVR_RODATA_IN_RAM__ is supported on all
  devices. It's defined to 0 or 1.
- A new optimization tries to improve code generation for indirect
  memory accesses on Reduced Tiny devices. It can be controlled by the
  new compiler option -mfuse-add=level where level may be 0, 1 or 2.
- On the Reduced Tiny devices, the meaning of register constraint "w"
  has been changed. It now constrains the registers R24...R31 as is the
  case for all the other devices.
