References and Acknowledgements

   GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
   supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
   GNU Compiler Collection.

   A list of [6]successful builds is updated as new information becomes
   available.

   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
   contributed new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other changes as
   well as test results to GCC. This [7]amazing group of volunteers is
   what makes GCC successful.

                             GCC 4.9 Release Series
                        Changes, New Features, and Fixes

Caveats

     * The mudflap run time checker has been removed. The mudflap options
       remain, but do nothing.
     * Support for a number of older systems and recently unmaintained or
       untested target ports of GCC has been declared obsolete in GCC 4.9.
       Unless there is activity to revive them, the next release of GCC
       will have their sources permanently removed.
       The following ports for individual systems on particular
       architectures have been obsoleted:
          + Solaris 9 (*-*-solaris2.9). Details can be found in the
            [1]announcement.
     * On AArch64, the singleton vector types int64x1_t, uint64x1_t and
       float64x1_t exported by arm_neon.h are defined to be the same as
       their base types. This results in incorrect application of
       parameter passing rules to arguments of types int64x1_t and
       uint64x1_t, with respect to the AAPCS64 ABI specification. In
       addition, names of C++ functions with parameters of these types
       (including float64x1_t) are not mangled correctly. The current
       typedef declarations also unintentionally allow implicit casting
       between singleton vector types and their base types. These issues
       will be resolved in a near future release. See [2]PR60825 for more
       information.

   More information on porting to GCC 4.9 from previous versions of GCC
   can be found in the [3]porting guide for this release.

General Optimizer Improvements

     * AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector, is now available on
       ARM.
     * UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (ubsan), a fast undefined behavior
       detector, has been added and can be enabled via
       -fsanitize=undefined. Various computations will be instrumented to
       detect undefined behavior at runtime. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is
       currently available for the C and C++ languages.
     * Link-time optimization (LTO) improvements:
          + Type merging was rewritten. The new implementation is
            significantly faster and uses less memory.
          + Better partitioning algorithm resulting in less streaming
            during link time.
          + Early removal of virtual methods reduces the size of object
            files and improves link-time memory usage and compile time.
          + Function bodies are now loaded on-demand and released early
            improving overall memory usage at link time.
          + C++ hidden keyed methods can now be optimized out.
          + When using a linker plugin, compiling with the -flto option
            now generates slim object files (.o) which only contain
            intermediate language representation for LTO. Use
            -ffat-lto-objects to create files which contain additionally
            the object code. To generate static libraries suitable for LTO
            processing, use gcc-ar and gcc-ranlib; to list symbols from a
            slim object file use gcc-nm. (This requires that ar, ranlib
            and nm have been compiled with plugin support.)
       Memory usage building Firefox with debug enabled was reduced from
       15GB to 3.5GB; link time from 1700 seconds to 350 seconds.
     * Inter-procedural optimization improvements:
          + New type inheritance analysis module improving
            devirtualization. Devirtualization now takes into account
            anonymous name-spaces and the C++11 final keyword.
          + New speculative devirtualization pass (controlled by
            -fdevirtualize-speculatively.
          + Calls that were speculatively made direct are turned back to
            indirect where direct call is not cheaper.
          + Local aliases are introduced for symbols that are known to be
            semantically equivalent across shared libraries improving
            dynamic linking times.
     * Feedback directed optimization improvements:
          + Profiling of programs using C++ inline functions is now more
            reliable.
          + New time profiling determines typical order in which functions
            are executed.
          + A new function reordering pass (controlled by
            -freorder-functions) significantly reduces startup time of
            large applications. Until binutils support is completed, it is
            effective only with link-time optimization.
          + Feedback driven indirect call removal and devirtualization now
            handle cross-module calls when link-time optimization is
            enabled.

New Languages and Language specific improvements

     * Version 4.0 of the [4]OpenMP specification is now supported in the
       C and C++ compilers and starting with the 4.9.1 release also in the
       Fortran compiler. The new -fopenmp-simd option can be used to
       enable OpenMP's SIMD directives, while ignoring other OpenMP
       directives. The new [5]-fsimd-cost-model= option permits to tune
       the vectorization cost model for loops annotated with OpenMP and
       Cilk Plus simd directives; -Wopenmp-simd warns when the current
       costmodel overrides simd directives set by the user.
     * The -Wdate-time option has been added for the C, C++ and Fortran
       compilers, which warns when the __DATE__, __TIME__ or __TIMESTAMP__
       macros are used. Those macros might prevent bit-wise-identical
       reproducible compilations.

  Ada

     * GNAT switched to Ada 2012 instead of Ada 2005 by default.

  C family

     * Support for colorizing diagnostics emitted by GCC has been added.
       The [6]-fdiagnostics-color=auto will enable it when outputting to
       terminals, -fdiagnostics-color=always unconditionally. The
       GCC_COLORS environment variable can be used to customize the colors
       or disable coloring. If GCC_COLORS variable is present in the
       environment, the default is -fdiagnostics-color=auto, otherwise
       -fdiagnostics-color=never.
       Sample diagnostics output:
    $ g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -S -Wall test.C
    test.C: In function `int foo()':
    test.C:1:14: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-W
return-type]
     int foo () { }
                  ^
    test.C:2:46: error: template instantiation depth exceeds maximum of 900 (use
 -ftemplate-depth= to increase the maximum) instantiating `struct X<100>'
     template <int N> struct X { static const int value = X<N-1>::value; }; temp
late struct X<1000>;
                                                  ^
    test.C:2:46:   recursively required from `const int X<999>::value'
    test.C:2:46:   required from `const int X<1000>::value'
    test.C:2:88:   required from here

    test.C:2:46: error: incomplete type `X<100>' used in nested name specifier

     * With the new [7]#pragma GCC ivdep, the user can assert that there
       are no loop-carried dependencies which would prevent concurrent
       execution of consecutive iterations using SIMD (single instruction
       multiple data) instructions.
     * Support for [8]Cilk Plus has been added and can be enabled with the
       -fcilkplus option. Cilk Plus is an extension to the C and C++
       languages to support data and task parallelism. The present
       implementation follows ABI version 1.2; all features but _Cilk_for
       have been implemented.

  C

     * ISO C11 atomics (the _Atomic type specifier and qualifier and the
       <stdatomic.h> header) are now supported.
     * ISO C11 generic selections (_Generic keyword) are now supported.
     * ISO C11 thread-local storage (_Thread_local, similar to GNU C
       __thread) is now supported.
     * ISO C11 support is now at a similar level of completeness to ISO
       C99 support: substantially complete modulo bugs, extended
       identifiers (supported except for corner cases when
       -fextended-identifiers is used), floating-point issues (mainly but
       not entirely relating to optional C99 features from Annexes F and
       G) and the optional Annexes K (Bounds-checking interfaces) and L
       (Analyzability).
     * A new C extension __auto_type provides a subset of the
       functionality of C++11 auto in GNU C.

  C++

     * The G++ implementation of [9]C++1y return type deduction for normal
       functions has been updated to conform to [10]N3638, the proposal
       accepted into the working paper. Most notably, it adds
       decltype(auto) for getting decltype semantics rather than the
       template argument deduction semantics of plain auto:

int& f();
         auto  i1 = f(); // int
decltype(auto) i2 = f(); // int&

     * G++ supports [11]C++1y lambda capture initializers:

[x = 42]{ ... };

       Actually, they have been accepted since GCC 4.5, but now the
       compiler doesn't warn about them with -std=c++1y, and supports
       parenthesized and brace-enclosed initializers as well.
     * G++ supports [12]C++1y variable length arrays. G++ has supported
       GNU/C99-style VLAs for a long time, but now additionally supports
       initializers and lambda capture by reference. In C++1y mode G++
       will complain about VLA uses that are not permitted by the draft
       standard, such as forming a pointer to VLA type or applying sizeof
       to a VLA variable. Note that it now appears that VLAs will not be
       part of C++14, but will be part of a separate document and then
       perhaps C++17.

void f(int n) {
  int a[n] = { 1, 2, 3 }; // throws std::bad_array_length if n < 3
  [&a]{ for (int i : a) { cout << i << endl; } }();
  &a; // error, taking address of VLA
}

     * G++ supports the [13]C++1y [[deprecated]] attribute modulo bugs in
       the underlying [[gnu::deprecated]] attribute. Classes and functions
       can be marked deprecated and a diagnostic message added:

class A;
int bar(int n);
#if __cplusplus > 201103
class [[deprecated("A is deprecated in C++14; Use B instead")]] A;
[[deprecated("bar is unsafe; use foo() instead")]]
int bar(int n);

int foo(int n);
class B;
#endif
A aa; // warning: 'A' is deprecated : A is deprecated in C++14; Use B instead
int j = bar(2); // warning: 'int bar(int)' is deprecated : bar is unsafe; use fo
o() instead

     * G++ supports [14]C++1y digit separators. Long numeric literals can
       be subdivided with a single quote ' to enhance readability:

int i = 1048576;
int j = 1'048'576;
int k = 0x10'0000;
int m = 0'004'000'000;
int n = 0b0001'0000'0000'0000'0000'0000;

double x = 1.602'176'565e-19;
double y = 1.602'176'565e-1'9;

     * G++ supports [15]C++1y generic (polymorphic) lambdas.

// a functional object that will increment any type
auto incr = [](auto x) { return x++; };

     * As a GNU extension, G++ supports explicit template parameter syntax
       for generic lambdas. This can be combined in the expected way with
       the standard auto syntax.

// a functional object that will add two like-type objects
auto add = [] <typename T> (T a, T b) { return a + b; };

     * G++ supports unconstrained generic functions as specified by
       S:4.1.2 and S:5.1.1 of [16]N3889: Concepts Lite Specification.
       Briefly, auto may be used as a type-specifier in a parameter
       declaration of any function declarator in order to introduce an
       implicit function template parameter, akin to generic lambdas.

// the following two function declarations are equivalent
auto incr(auto x) { return x++; }
template <typename T>
auto incr(T x) { return x++; }

    Runtime Library (libstdc++)

     * [17]Improved support for C++11, including:
          + support for <regex>;
          + The associative containers in <map> and <set> and the
            unordered associative containers in <unordered_map> and
            <unordered_set> meet the allocator-aware container
            requirements;
     * [18]Improved experimental support for the upcoming ISO C++
       standard, C++14, including:
          + fixing constexpr member functions without const;
          + implementation of the std::exchange() utility function;
          + addressing tuples by type;
          + implemention of std::make_unique;
          + implemention of std::shared_lock;
          + making std::result_of SFINAE-friendly;
          + adding operator() to integral_constant;
          + adding user-defined literals for standard library types
            std::basic_string, std::chrono::duration, and std::complex;
          + adding two range overloads to non-modifying sequence oprations
            std::equal and std::mismatch;
          + adding IO manipulators for quoted strings;
          + adding constexpr members to <utility>, <complex>, <chrono>,
            and some containers;
          + adding compile-time std::integer_sequence;
          + adding cleaner transformation traits;
          + making <functional>s operator functors easier to use and more
            generic;
     * An implementation of std::experimental::optional.
     * An implementation of std::experimental::string_view.
     * The non-standard function std::copy_exception has been deprecated
       and will be removed in a future version. std::make_exception_ptr
       should be used instead.

  Fortran

     * Compatibility notice:
          + Module files: The version of the module files (.mod) has been
            incremented; additionally, module files are now compressed.
            Fortran MODULEs compiled by earlier GCC versions have to be
            recompiled, when they are USEd by files compiled with GCC 4.9.
            GCC 4.9 is not able to read .mod files of earlier GCC
            versions; attempting to do so gives an error message. Note:
            The ABI of the produced assembler data itself has not changed:
            object files and libraries are fully compatible with older
            versions (except as stated below).
          + ABI changes:
               o The [19]argument passing ABI has changed for scalar dummy
                 arguments of type INTEGER, REAL, COMPLEX and LOGICAL,
                 which have both the VALUE and the OPTIONAL attributes.
               o To support finalization the virtual table associated with
                 polymorphic variables has changed. Code containing CLASS
                 should be recompiled, including all files which define
                 derived types involved in the type definition used by
                 polymorphic variables. (Note: Due to the incremented
                 module version, trying to mix old code with new code will
                 usually give an error message.)
          + GNU Fortran no longer deallocates allocatable variables or
            allocatable components of variables declared in the main
            program. Since Fortran 2008, the standard explicitly states
            that variables declared in the Fortran main program
            automatically have the SAVE attribute.
          + When opening files, the close-on-exec flag is set if the
            system supports such a feature. This is generally considered
            good practice these days, but if there is a need to pass file
            descriptors to child processes the parent process must now
            remember to clear the close-on-exec flag by calling fcntl(),
            e.g. via ISO_C_BINDING, before executing the child process.
     * The deprecated command-line option -fno-whole-file has been
       removed. (-fwhole-file is the default since GCC 4.6.)
       -fwhole-file/-fno-whole-file continue to be accepted but do not
       influence the code generation.
     * The compiler no longer unconditionally warns about DO loops with
       zero iterations. This warning is now controlled by the -Wzerotrips
       option, which is implied by -Wall.
     * The new NO_ARG_CHECK attribute of the [20]!GCC$ directive can be
       used to disable the type-kind-rank (TKR) argument check for a dummy
       argument. The feature is similar to ISO/IEC TS 29133:2012's
       TYPE(*), except that it additionally also disables the rank check.
       Variables with NO_ARG_CHECK have to be dummy arguments and may only
       be used as argument to ISO_C_BINDING's C_LOC and as actual argument
       to another NO_ARG_CHECK dummy argument; also the other constraints
       of TYPE(*) apply. The dummy arguments should be declared as scalar
       or assumed-size variable of type type(*) (recommended) - or of type
       integer, real, complex or logical. With NO_ARG_CHECK, a pointer to
       the data without further type or shape information is passed,
       similar to C's void*. Note that also TS 29113's
       type(*),dimension(..) accepts arguments of any type and rank;
       contrary to NO_ARG_CHECK assumed-rank arguments pass an array
       descriptor which contains the array shape and stride of the
       argument.
     * [21]Fortran 2003:
          + Finalization is now supported. It is currently only done for a
            subset of those situations in which it should occur.
          + Experimental support for scalar character components with
            deferred length (i.e. allocatable string length) in derived
            types has been added. (Deferred-length character variables are
            supported since GCC 4.6.)
     * [22]Fortran 2008:
          + When STOP or ERROR STOP are used to terminate the execution
            and any exception (but inexact) is signaling, a warning is
            printed to ERROR_UNIT, indicating which exceptions are
            signaling. The [23]-ffpe-summary= command-line option can be
            used to fine-tune for which exceptions the warning should be
            shown.
          + Rounding on input (READ) is now handled on systems where
            strtod honours the rounding mode. (For output, rounding is
            supported since GCC 4.5.) Note that for input, the compatible
            rounding mode is handled as nearest (i.e., for a tie, rounding
            to an even last significant [cf. IEC 60559:1989] - while
            compatible rounds away from zero for a tie).

  Go

     * GCC 4.9 provides a complete implementation of the Go 1.2.1 release.

New Targets and Target Specific Improvements

  AArch64

     * The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through
       intrinsics. These are enabled when the architecture supports these
       and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and
       -march=armv8-a+crypto options.
     * Initial support for ILP32 has now been added to the compiler. This
       is now available through the command-line option -mabi=ilp32.
       Support for ILP32 is considered experimental as the ABI
       specification is still beta.
     * Coverage of more of the ISA including the SIMD extensions has been
       added. The Advanced SIMD intrinsics have also been improved.
     * The new local register allocator (LRA) is now on by default for the
       AArch64 backend.
     * The REE (Redundant extension elimination) pass has now been enabled
       by default for the AArch64 backend.
     * Tuning for the Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 has been improved.
     * Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57
       and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53
       option.
     * A number of structural changes have been made to both the ARM and
       AArch64 backends to facilitate improved code-generation.

  ARC

     * A port for Synopsys Designware ARC has been contributed by Embecosm
       and Synopsys Inc.

  ARM

     * Use of Advanced SIMD (Neon) for 64-bit scalar computations has been
       disabled by default. This was found to generate better code in only
       a small number of cases. It can be turned back on with the
       -mneon-for-64bits option.
     * Further support for the ARMv8-A architecture, notably implementing
       the restriction around IT blocks in the Thumb32 instruction set has
       been added. The -mrestrict-it option can be used with
       -march=armv7-a or the -march=armv7ve options to make code
       generation fully compatible with the deprecated instructions in
       ARMv8-A.
     * Support has now been added for the ARMv7ve variant of the
       architecture. This can be used by the -march=armv7ve option.
     * The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through
       intrinsics and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and
       mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 options.
     * LRA is now on by default for the ARM target. This can be turned off
       using the -mno-lra option. This option is a purely transitionary
       command-line option and will be removed in a future release. We are
       interested in any bug reports regarding functional and performance
       regressions with LRA.
     * A new option -mslow-flash-data to improve performance of programs
       fetching data on slow flash memory has now been introduced for the
       ARMv7-M profile cores.
     * A new option -mpic-data-is-text-relative for targets that allows
       data segments to be relative to text segments has been added. This
       is on by default for all targets except VxWorks RTP.
     * A number of infrastructural changes have been made to both the ARM
       and AArch64 backends to facilitate improved code-generation.
     * GCC now supports Cortex-A12 and the Cortex-R7 through the
       -mcpu=cortex-a12 and -mcpu=cortex-r7 options.
     * GCC now has tuning for the Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 through the
       -mcpu=cortex-a57 and -mcpu=cortex-a53 options.
     * Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57
       and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53
       option. Similar support was added for the combination of Cortex-A15
       and Cortex-A7 through the -mcpu=cortex-a15.cortex-a7 option.
     * Further performance optimizations for the Cortex-A15 and the
       Cortex-M4 have been added.
     * A number of code generation improvements for Thumb2 to reduce code
       size when compiling for the M-profile processors.

  IA-32/x86-64

     * -mfpmath=sse is now implied by -ffast-math on all targets where
       SSE2 is supported.
     * Intel AVX-512 support was added to GCC. That includes inline
       assembly support, new registers and extending existing ones, new
       intrinsics (covered by corresponding testsuite), and basic
       autovectorization. AVX-512 instructions are available via the
       following GCC switches: AVX-512 foundation instructions: -mavx512f,
       AVX-512 prefetch instructions: -mavx512pf, AVX-512 exponential and
       reciprocal instructions: -mavx512er, AVX-512 conflict detection
       instructions: -mavx512cd.
     * It is now possible to call x86 intrinsics from select functions in
       a file that are tagged with the corresponding target attribute
       without having to compile the entire file with the -mxxx option.
       This improves the usability of x86 intrinsics and is particularly
       useful when doing [24]Function Multiversioning.
     * GCC now supports the new Intel microarchitecture named Silvermont
       through -march=silvermont.
     * GCC now supports the new Intel microarchitecture named Broadwell
       through -march=broadwell.
     * Optimizing for other Intel microarchitectures have been renamed to
       -march=nehalem, westmere, sandybridge, ivybridge, haswell, bonnell.
     * -march=generic has been retuned for better support of Intel core
       and AMD Bulldozer architectures. Performance of AMD K7, K8, Intel
       Pentium-M, and Pentium4 based CPUs is no longer considered
       important for generic.
     * -mtune=intel can now be used to generate code running well on the
       most current Intel processors, which are Haswell and Silvermont for
       GCC 4.9.
     * Support to encode 32-bit assembly instructions in 16-bit format is
       now available through the -m16 command-line option.
     * Better inlining of memcpy and memset that is aware of value ranges
       and produces shorter alignment prologues.
     * -mno-accumulate-outgoing-args is now honored when unwind
       information is output. Argument accumulation is also now turned off
       for portions of programs optimized for size.
     * Support for new AMD family 15h processors (Excavator core) is now
       available through the -march=bdver4 and -mtune=bdver4 options.

  MSP430

     * A new command-line option -mcpu= has been added to the MSP430
       backend. This option is used to specify the ISA to be used.
       Accepted values are msp430 (the default), msp430x and msp430xv2.
       The ISA is no longer deduced from the -mmcu= option as there are
       far too many different MCU names. The -mmcu= option is still
       supported, and this is still used to select linker scripts and
       generate a C preprocessor symbol that will be recognised by the
       msp430.h header file.

  NDS32

     * A new nds32 port supports the 32-bit architecture from Andes
       Technology Corporation.
     * The port provides initial support for the V2, V3, V3m instruction
       set architectures.

  Nios II

     * A port for the Altera Nios II has been contributed by Mentor
       Graphics.

  PowerPC / PowerPC64 / RS6000

     * GCC now supports Power ISA 2.07, which includes support for
       Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM), Quadword atomics and several
       VMX and VSX additions, including Crypto, 64-bit integer, 128-bit
       integer and decimal integer operations.
     * Support for the POWER8 processor is now available through the
       -mcpu=power8 and -mtune=power8 options.
     * The libitm library has been modified to add a HTM fastpath that
       automatically uses POWER's HTM hardware instructions when it is
       executing on a HTM enabled processor.
     * Support for the new powerpc64le-linux platform has been added. It
       defaults to generating code that conforms to the ELFV2 ABI.

  S/390, System z

     * Support for the Transactional Execution Facility included with the
       IBM zEnterprise zEC12 processor has been added. A set of GCC style
       builtins as well as XLC style builtins are provided. The builtins
       are enabled by default when using the -march=zEC12 option but can
       explicitly be disabled with -mno-htm. Using the GCC builtins also
       libitm supports hardware transactions on S/390.
     * The hotpatch features allows to prepare functions for hotpatching.
       A certain amount of bytes is reserved before the function entry
       label plus a NOP is inserted at its very beginning to implement a
       backward jump when applying a patch. The feature can either be
       enabled per compilation unit via the command-line option -mhotpatch
       or per function using the hotpatch attribute.
     * The shrink wrap optimization is now supported on S/390 and enabled
       by default.
     * A major rework of the routines to determine which registers need to
       be saved and restored in function prologue/epilogue now allow to
       use floating point registers as save slots. This will happen for
       certain leaf function with -march=z10 or higher.
     * The LRA rtl pass replaces reload by default on S/390.

  RX

     * The port now allows to specify the RX100, RX200, and RX600
       processors with the command-line options -mcpu=rx100, -mcpu=rx200
       and -mcpu=rx600.

  SH

     * Minor improvements to code generated for integer arithmetic and
       code that involves the T bit.
     * Added support for the SH2A clips and clipu instructions. The
       compiler will now try to utilize them for min/max expressions such
       as max (-128, min (127, x)).
     * Added support for the cmp/str instruction through built-in
       functions such as __builtin_strlen. When not optimizing for size,
       the compiler will now expand calls to e.g. strlen as an inlined
       sequences which utilize the cmp/str instruction.
     * Improved code generated around volatile memory loads and stores.
     * The option -mcbranchdi has been deprecated. Specifying it will
       result in a warning and will not influence code generation.
     * The option -mcmpeqdi has been deprecated. Specifying it will result
       in a warning and will not influence code generation.

GCC 4.9.1

   This is the [25]list of problem reports (PRs) from GCC's bug tracking
   system that are known to be fixed in the 4.9.1 release. This list might
   not be complete (that is, it is possible that some PRs that have been
   fixed are not listed here).

   Version 4.0 of the [26]OpenMP specification is supported even in
   Fortran, not just C and C++.
