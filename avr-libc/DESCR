This is the standard library for Microchip (formerly Atmel) AVR
devices together with avr-gcc and avr-binutils.

The library contains most of the functionality required by the
ISO C standard, with the notable exception of wchar_t support.

It also contains a lot of auxiliary functionality targeted to
the AVR controller family. Further, it includes customizable
startup code, tailored to work together with the linker scripts
provided by the GNU Binutils, so for most AVR applications,
there is usually no need to provide project-specific files for
that purpose.
