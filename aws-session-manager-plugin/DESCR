Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that
lets you manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instances, on-premises instances and virtual machines. Session Manager
provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to
open inbound ports. When you use the Session Manager plugin with the AWS
CLI to start a session, the plugin builds the websocket connection to
your managed instances.
