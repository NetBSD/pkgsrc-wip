The Ayatana Indicators project is the continuation of Application
Indicators and System Indicators, two technologies developed by
Canonical Ltd. for the Unity7 desktop.

Application Indicators are a GTK implementation of the StatusNotifierItem
Specification (SNI) that was originally submitted to freedesktop.org
by KDE.

System Indicators are an extensions to the Application Indicators
idea.  System Indicators allow for far more widgets to be displayed
in the indicator's menu.

The Ayatana Indicators project is the new upstream for application
indicators, system indicators and associated projects with a focus
on making Ayatana Indicators a desktop agnostic technology.
