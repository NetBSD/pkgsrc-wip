$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.1 2006/09/02 16:38:13 dhowland Exp $

This package is currently several versions behind the latest version of
Azureus.  This is due to issues with NetBSD's binary Linux emulation.

Upgrading Azureus with the built-in updater will probably break this
package.  Consider disabling the automatic update check.
