- This package needs to be fixed or deleted since lang/sun-jre15 was deleted.
- AFAIK azureus will not work with NetBSD native java, therefore,
  this package uses Linux binary emulation.
  Should the package name be changed to reflect this?

- This package should be modified to support Linux.  Linux would not
  require the Suse compatibility packages.
  However, I had to downgrade to a much older version of Azureus in order
  to work with NetBSD's Linux binary emulation.  Native Linux would not
  have this problem (I assume) so it would want to have the latest version.
  Perhaps there should be two packages?
