Overview
The Backplane Open Source Database is the result of over three years of
development by FreeBSD and Linux guru Matthew Dillon and an enthusiastic
team of developers at Backplane, Inc. Now available to both open source and
corporate developers, Backplane serves as the basis for a new generation of
reliable and robust networked applications

Replicated RDBMS for Linux and FreeBSD
The Backplane Open Source Database is a replicated, transactional,
fault-tolerant relational database core. Currently supported on Linux and
FreeBSD, Backplane is designed to run on a large number of small servers
rather than a small number of large servers. With Backplane, it is possible
to spread the database nodes widely, allowing database operations to work
efficiently over WAN latencies while maintaining full transactional
coherency across the entire replication group.
