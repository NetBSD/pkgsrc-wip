Does it build / work on NetBSD-stable? 

This package can be compiled with or without gnome support; Same for SQL --
it can support MySQL or SQLite. Any ideas how we could add such packages
with deps nicely? The one I'm thinking of right now (add 6 different
packages: gnome-* and no-gnome-*, where * is nosql, mysql or sqlite) seems
quite unreasonable.
