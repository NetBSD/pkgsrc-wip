Ballerburg SDL is a classical castle combat game for GNU/Linux and other
systems that are supported by the SDL library. Two castles, separated by
a mountain, try to defeat each other with their cannonballs, either by
killing the opponent's king or by weakening the opponent enough so that
the king capitulates.
