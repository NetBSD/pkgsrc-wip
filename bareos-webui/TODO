This package should provide the Web UI for Bareos. It is currently in 
work and not yet finished. Parts of it were taken from the Nextcloud 
package. 

Open items:

- testing

Notes:

2022-12-05 Matthias Petermann: I don't use Bareos anymore, so I can't
make any meaningful contributions to this. I leave the package here
for reference purposes, should someone want to take this as a basis
for the (necessary) update or a full-fledged pkgsr package.
