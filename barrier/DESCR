Barrier is KVM software forked from Symless's synergy 1.9 codebase.
Synergy was a commercialized reimplementation of the original CosmoSynergy
written by Chris Schoeneman.

Whereas synergy has moved beyond its goals from the 1.x era, barrier aims
to maintain that simplicity. Barrier will let you use your keyboard and
mouse from machine A to control machine B (or more). It's that simple.
