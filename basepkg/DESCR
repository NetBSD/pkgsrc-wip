The basepkg is a build framework for NetBSD base system packages to make an
experiment for NetBSD syspkg.

It aims which makes it possible to managing NetBSD base system based on package
like as Debian apt, RHEL yum, and others.

The basepkg.sh builds all category packages into the "packages" directory.
We can manage these packages to own NetBSD system using pkg_add(1),
pkg_delete(1) and pkg_info(1) same as pkgsrc(7).

Please read README for detail.
