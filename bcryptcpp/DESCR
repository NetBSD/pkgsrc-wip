A C++ wrapper around bcrypt (origin: Open BSD) password hashing.

Former version used OpenBSD as origin. Since the hash output was
not fully compatible to common web services we now use source from
node.bcrypt.

But also the web services might differ each other, so just use the
hashes generated by this library internally in your application.
