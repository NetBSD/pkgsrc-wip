This is a development version of BEAST/BSE, the BEdevilled Audio SysTem
and the Bedevilled Sound Engine, the BSE API is not considered to be stable.
The overall goal of this project is to become an audio system that supports
multiple song and sample formats (besides the project specific .bse format)
as well as synthesis networks and allows full fledged editing and
manipulation of those. Sample manipulation includes generation of new
sounds from module networks, based on various kinds of audio synthesis.
