Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools 
for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used 
tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. 
For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, 
complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in 
widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.
