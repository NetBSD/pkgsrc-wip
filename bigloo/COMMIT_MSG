Bigloo is a Scheme development environment that includes a compiler
generating C code and Java classes, and an interpreter. Bigloo is
the tool of choice for building autonomous applications in Scheme.
It is mostly conformant to the Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme with many extensions:
  - lexical and syntactic builtin parser generators;
  - pattern-matching;
  - foreign languages interface (connection to C and to Java);
  - modules;
  - object-oriented class-based programming;
  - preemptive multi-threading;
  - unicode characters and strings;
  - posix programming (process, pipe, socket);
  - openssl;
  - multimedia libraries;
  - event loops and event-based programming (libuv).
