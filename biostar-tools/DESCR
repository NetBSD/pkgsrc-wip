Biostar-Tools is a metaport for installing all the tools necessary to
work through the Biostar Handbook, except for bedGrapToBigWig, which
has license restrictions.  If you need bedGraphToBigWig, run

	cd /usr/pkgsrc/biology/ucsc-userapps && make install clean

The handbook instructs the user to install these tools mostly via
bioconda, which then requires the user to activate the bioconda
environment each time they want to use the tools.  This meta-package
installs all of the tools except emboss to the default PATH so they
just work without any special environment.  Emboss commands are
installed to /usr/pkg/emboss/bin due to conflicts with other packages.
