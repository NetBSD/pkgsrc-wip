Blueproxy is a simple proxy server to convert Bluetooth RFCOMM connections into
TCP connections. This frees Bluetooth application programmers from having to
worry about getting Bluetooth bindings for their language of choice (in my
case, OCaml). Notable features include sending preambles to allow a single TCP
server to aggregrate multiple Bluetooth sensors, and a scanning mode to
continuously detect Bluetooth devices entering into range of a sensor.
