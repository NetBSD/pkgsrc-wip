Virtual ALSA PCM device implements BlueZ 5 audio profiles. Lets ALSA apps
stream and capture using your wireless headset without adding PulseAudio
dependencies or implementing its APIs. Pass bluealsa instead of your sound
card identifier to your apps or tools such as aplay, arecord and amixer.
See automation example in acme.js.org/ctl ear section.
