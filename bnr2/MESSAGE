BNR2 is still quite unstable, but it is useful.  If you intend to use BNR2,
please subscribe to its Yahoo Group for bug/feature discussion (yes, the
list name is bnr1, not bnr2):

    bnr1-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

The data directory for BNR2 is currently hardcoded to $HOME/BNR2.  To use a
different data directory, create a symlink with that name, pointing to
another directory for storage of BNR2 data files.
