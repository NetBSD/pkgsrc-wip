        the PC speaker beep generator and the OPL3 FM generator.
      - PCM format conversion to 16 bit signed little endian.

Changes in 2.6.7 (November 2, 2014):

- CPU / CPUDB
  - Implemented AVX-512BW/AVX-512DQ/AVX-512VL extensions emulation.
  - implemented AVX512-IFMA532 instructions emulation.
  - implemented AVX512-VBMI instructions emulation.

  - Fixed Bochs segmentation fault crash with Handlers Chaining Speedups enabled when
    compiling with gcc, especially with low optimization levels.
  - Reverted removal of reporting Architectural Perfmon support in pre-defined CPUID modules.
    Windows 8 and Windows 10 require Performance Monitoring to be reported to boot.
    To workaround possible Windows 7 64-bit installation issues: use bx_generic CPUID module,
    which doesn't report Performance Monitoring in CPUID.

- GUI and display libraries
  - The VGA update timer and the status LED timer now always use the realtime mode
    independent from the 'clock' option setting.
  - Added native SDL2 GUI support to Bochs. To enable configure with --with-sdl2.

  - Write enhanced gui debugger settings to file on exit and restore on initialization.

    - Added USB port specific option 'size' for VVFAT disks (range 128M ... 128G).
      If the size is not specified or invalid, it defaults to 504M.
  - Hard drive / HD image
    - Fixed crash when using a "fixed" type VPC image.

- ROM BIOS
  - Fixed int74_function() for 4-byte (wheel mouse) packets.

- LGPL'd VGABIOS updated from CVS (fixed building VBE modes list)

- Misc
