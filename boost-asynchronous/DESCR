Asynchronous is first of all an architecture tool. It allows
organizing a complete application into Thread Worlds, each world
having the possibility to use the same or different threadpools for
long-lasting tasks. The library provides an implementation of the
Active Object pattern, extended to allow many Active Objects to live
in the same World. It provides several Threadpools and many parallel
algorithms making use of it.  And most important of all, it allows
simple, blocking-free asynchronous programming based on thread-safe
callbacks.

This is particularly relevant for Designers who often have headaches
bringing the notion of threads into class diagrams. These usually do
not mix well. Asynchronous solves this problems: it allows
representing a Thread World as a Component or Package, objects of this
Component or Package living into the corresponding thread.

Note: Asynchronous is not part of the Boost library.
