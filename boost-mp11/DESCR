Mp11 is a C++11 metaprogramming library based on template aliases and
variadic templates.  It implements the approach outlined in the
article "Simple C++11 metaprogramming" and its sequel:

- http://pdimov.com/cpp2/simple_cxx11_metaprogramming_2.html

Reading these articles before proceeding with the documentation is
_highly_ recommended.

The library is intended to be placed in a subdirectory `libs/mp11` in
a Boost distribution, but can also be used standalone, although it
does require Boost.Config. A single-header form is available in
include/boost/mp11_single.hpp.
