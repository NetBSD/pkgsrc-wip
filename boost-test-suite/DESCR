This package provides a simple framework for running tests of Boost
(http://www.boost.org/).  Once installed, the entire Boost test suite
may be run by invoking the following script, ideally on a regular
basis.

   @PREFIX@/sbin/boost-test-suite
   @PREFIX@/sbin/boost-test-suite -p	# run unpatched tests

This script takes care of downloading the necessary Boost test script
and running it with parameters appropriate for simple testing
applications.  It may, however, be configured for more advanced uses.
The testing process and requirements are described in greater detail
at the following site:

   http://www.boost.org/development/running_regression_tests.html

Note that the Boost test framework requires a network connection, as
it updates the local copy of Boost with the most current version prior
to running the tests and then uploads the results, which are
summarized here.

   http://www.boost.org/development/tests/trunk/developer/summary.html

It is important that the test suite is run regularly as it helps
ensure that the pkgsrc packages are correct.
