      This test is orchestrated by
      <a href="http://pkgsrc-wip.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pkgsrc-wip/wip/boost-test-suite/">boost-test-suite</a>,
      a package within the
      <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>
      <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org">pkgsrc</a>
      system.  The package allows easy and automated operation of the 
      <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>
      test suite, with or without a set of patches.  Consequently, it
      aids in evaluating
      <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>
      on multiple platforms, it provides a means of verifying
      potential patches for the
      <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/boost/README.html">Boost pkgsrc package</a>
      prior to deploying packages for new versions of
      <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a>,
      and it provides a means of exercising a system's compilers.  The
      test suite itself is described more completely
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/development/running_regression_tests.html">here</a>
      and the results of all tests are summarized
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/development/tests/trunk/developer/summary.html">here</a>.
