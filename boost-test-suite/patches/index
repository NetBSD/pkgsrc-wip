# This directory contains patches under test for the pkgsrc system to
# ensure that it supports current releases of Boost.  They are derived
# from the main pkgsrc package for Boost and will be incorporated into
# future pkgsrc packages.

# In this file, comments, which are ignored, begin with a pound sign
# (#) and continue to the end of the line.  Additionally, blank lines
# are ignored.

# URL to publish for access to these patches.
#
# There should be at most a single line beginning with 'URL:'.  The
# remainder of the line is taken to be a URL that will be published as
# a reference to these patches.  If no such line is present, it is
# assumed that the patches are private and no URL will be published.
URL: http://pkgsrc-wip.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pkgsrc-wip/wip/boost-test-suite/patches/

# URLs for each patch file
#
# Each line (other than comments, blank lines, and the optional 'URL:'
# line) contains the URL for importing a single patch file.  Each URL
# should be interpretable by ftp(1).  By convention, patch filenames
# should begin with the string 'patch-'.
