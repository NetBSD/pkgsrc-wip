This is a mini-SNMP daemon. The basic daemon implements the system
group and a number of private extensions to manage the UDP transport
mapping, communities, trap destinations and loadable modules. In this
form it can be used to provide remote access to arbitrary data that
can be described in the form as required by the SMI. The daemon speaks
both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.
