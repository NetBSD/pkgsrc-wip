The Bub's Brothers is a network, client-server game. It does not mean that you
cannot play it alone, on a non-networked computer, but that will just be less
fun. The game is written in the Python programming language.

* The server is the program that you only need to run on one machine. It is a
non-graphical program that computes the gameplay and sends display data to the
clients via the network.

* The client is the display program that must be executed on every machine.
