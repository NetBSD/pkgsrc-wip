Bugsx is a program which draws biomorphs based on parametric plots of
Fourier sine and cosine series and let's you play with them interactively
using the genetic algorithm.

For more information about the theoretic backgrounds of
bugsx consult Joshua R. Smith's paper distributed with this
program in gzip'ed postscript format as bugs.ps.gz. You have
to uncompress this file with 'gunzip' before you can print it.
Gunzip should be available at an archive near you.
