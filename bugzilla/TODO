This is a first try at a Bugzilla package but there are a few things to
be aware of:

- It's not complete yet as it provides the user with no instruction on how
to setup the mySQL side of Bugzilla.
- I'm not a Bugzilla person so I'm not sure if the application defaults
are appropriate or should be changed.
- You need to install the p5-Chart pkg which is in pkgsrc-wip as well.
However, I have not tested that it actually works with Bugzilla.

I'll doubt I will get much more time to work on this so I'm importing it
in the hope that someone can finish off the package from here. If anyone
feels they want to give it a go and can test it adequately please feel free
to hack away at it.

Sort of tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Regards,

Adrian.
