Bupstash is a tool for encrypted backups - if you need secure backups, Bupstash
is the tool for you.

Bupstash was designed to have:

 * Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store thousands of encrypted
   directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would
   require.
 * Strong privacy - Data is encrypted client side and the repository never
   needs has access to the decryption keys.
 * Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be
   anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.
 * Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.
 * Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on
   high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.
 * Secure remote access controls - Ransomware, angry spouses, and disgruntled
   business partners will be powerless to delete your remote backups.
 * Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time
   and skips that work.
 * Fantastic performance with low ram usage - Bupstash won't bog down your
   production servers.
 * Safety against malicious attacks - Bupstash is written in a memory safe
   language to dramatically reduce the attack surface over the network.
