Convolution is a core concept in today's cutting-edge technologies of deep
learning and computer vision. Singularly cogent in application to digital signal
processing, the convolution theorem is regarded as the most powerful tool in
modern scientific analysis. Long utilised for accelerating the application of
filters to images, fast training of convolutional neural networks exploit the
convolution theorem to accelerate training and inference in the ubiquitous
applications of computer vision that, today, are at the vanguard of the evolving
artificially intelligent world in which we are becoming increasingly immersed
