   The documentation that comes with C News has been installed under
   ${PREFIX}/share/doc/cnews.

   If this is an update, the spool and config directories under
   ${CNEWSARTS} and ${CNEWSCTL} are untouched.

   If this is a fresh install, sample config files have been installed
   in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/cnews and copied to ${CNEWSCTL}.

   Especially edit:

	mailname, whoami, organization, mailpaths, sys, readnews.ctl,
	postdefltgroup, localgroups and sys

   to suit your local system and news topology. Check that you have
   valid aliases in report.ctl, so any problem can be reported by
   mail.

   C News itself does not handle NNTP. Install the news/nnrpd package
   in addition.
