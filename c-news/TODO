# C News pkg issues

- use USE_PKGINSTALL=YES for /var/news

- sync patch list with dinoex.org

- provide sample cron entries for user 'news' in share/examples/c-news

- add DESTDIR support

- to comply with the license, make sure that information about the sponsors
  gets installed (just install all the README files)

- for sizeof(time_t) == 8 != sizeof(long)
  make sure the parts that tinker with time_t can cope with an int64_t,
  see compiler warnings about

    libcnews/mkinperm.c
    util/getabsdate.c
    inject/defaults.c
    input/newsspool.c

  See also <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2467418/portable-way-to-deal-with-64-32-bit-time-t>
  which suggests using strftime(3).

- run the regression tests
  o getabsdate test fails (prints time_t with %ld)
