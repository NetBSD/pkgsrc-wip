C2Rust helps you migrate C99-compliant code to Rust. The translator
(or transpiler) produces unsafe Rust code that closely mirrors the
input C code. The primary goal of the translator is to preserve
functionality; test suites should continue to pass after translation.
Generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from C ultimately requires
manual effort.
