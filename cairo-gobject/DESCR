Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
Currently supported output targets include the X Window System, Quartz, Win32,
image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
include OpenGL (through glitz), XCB, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking
advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X
Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic
Bezier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and
antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any
affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)

Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but
bindings are available for several different programming languages.
