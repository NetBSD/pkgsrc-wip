GENIVI CommonAPI C++ is a C++ framework for interprocess and network
communication. The basic objective is not to provide a new mechanism for
interprocess or network communication (IPC), but to define a high-level
C++ API, which can be used for different mechanisms. The benefit for
C++developers should be that they are relieved from details of proprietary
or little-known communication frameworks or protocols.
