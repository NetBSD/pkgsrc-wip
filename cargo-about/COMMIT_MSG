devel/cargo-about: update to 0.6.6

0.6.6 - 2024-11-19
Added

    PR#268 resolved #267 by adding a unicode-ident workaround to compensate for the LICENSE-UNICODE file more closely matching the Unicode-3.0 SPDX identifier rather than the expected Unicode-DFS-2016 one.

0.6.5 - 2024-11-18
Added

    PR#261 resolved #246 by adding an --offline (as well as --locked and --frozen) option to the generate command.
    PR#266 resolved #230 by adding a --target option to generate, allowing one to specify one or more targets to filter the dependency graph by, overriding the targets configuration option.

Changed

    PR#262 resolved #258 by using LTO for release builds, slightly decreasing binary sizes.

Fixed

    PR#263 resolved #238 by adding the native-certs feature to use the native certificate store. This feature is not enabled by default as it is only required for corporate environments that man in the middle network traffic.
    PR#265 resolved #198 by detecting if the parent process is powershell and exiting with an error if cargo-about's output is being redirected instead of using the -o option, as powershell is terrible and doesn't use utf-8 encoding by default.
    PR#266 resolved #222 by adding some additional documentation on https://clearlydefined.io.
