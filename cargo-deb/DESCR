cargo-deb is a Cargo helper that automates the creation of Debian
(.deb) packages from Rust projects, enabling seamless distribution and
installation on Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu. It
simplifies the packaging process by leveraging information already
present in the Cargo.toml file, and allows customization for
Debian-specific fields such as maintainer, dependencies, license, and
description to meet distribution standards. This makes it easier to
share Rust applications with users, who can then install or upgrade
them with a single .deb file, ensuring better integration with system
dependencies and package management workflows.
