A diverse collection of eight TrueType fonts.

The FLF were created by various authors including myself and Mike
Wright. When Casady & Greene, Inc. closed the rights went back to
the authors. I created ChicagoFLF and CheckboxFLF. You are free to
use them as you wish. I consider those two in the public domain.

Robin Casady

Besides the ones you already know about, my fonts are:
CollegiateFLF DorovarFLF GazelleFLF GregorianFLF JottFLF KellsFLF MeathFLF
