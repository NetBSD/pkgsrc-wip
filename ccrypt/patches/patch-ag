 The use of the \fB-T\fP option is unsafe for encryption because the
 original plaintext will remain in unused sectors of the file system.
-.SH EMACS PACKAGE
-
-There is an emacs package for reading and writing encrypted files.
-(Note that this package currently only works with emacs, not with
-xemacs.)  This package hooks into the low-level file I/O functions of
-emacs, prompting the user for a password where appropriate. It is
-implemented in much the same way as support for compressed files; in
-fact, the package, whose name is jka-compr-ccrypt, is based directly
-on the jka-compr package which is part of GNU Emacs. It handles both
-encrypted and compressed files (although currently not encrypted
-compressed files).
-
-To use the package, simply load jka-compr-ccrypt and edit as usual.
-When you open a file with the ".cpt" extension, emacs will prompt you
-for a password for the file. It will remember the password for the
-buffer, and when you save the file later, it will be automatically
-encrypted again (provided you save it with a ".cpt" extension). Except
-for the password prompt, the operation of the package should be
-transparent to the user. The package also handles compressed ".gz",
-".bz2", and ".Z" files, and it should be used instead of, not in
-addition to, jka-compr. The command M-x ccrypt-set-buffer-password can
-be used to change the current password of a buffer.
-
-The simplest way to use this package is to include the lines
-.IP
-.nf
- (setq load-path (cons "\fIpath\fP" load-path))
- (require 'jka-compr-ccrypt "jka-compr-ccrypt.el")
-.fi
-.LP
-in your .emacs file, where \fIpath\fP is the directory which holds the
-file jka-compr-ccrypt.el.
-
-Limitations of the emacs package: there is no guarantee that
-unencrypted information cannot leak to the file system; in fact, the
-package sometimes writes unencrypted data to temporary files. However,
-auto-saved files are normally treated correctly (i.e., encrypted).
-For details, see the comments in the file jka-compr-ccrypt.el.
