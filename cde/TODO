As of 2012-10-03 CDE doesn't build yet. I (Jelle Hermsen) am almost done
adding most basic NetBSD compatibility. I've made this preliminary pkgsrc
package.

First off there are two tiny things:
- during the build of doc it somehow it loses track of imake, probably a path
  mixup
- the NetBSD config in config/cf/NetBSD.cf is really old, can be replaced by
  for example a config from xorg


The current patches are generated with mkpatches and consist mostly of
changes to CSRG_BASED:

I have searched the codebase for occurences of __FreeBSD__ and I'm looking
to change them to CSRG_BASED where ever this is possible. Here you find a list
of files I've located and actions I took. I added a + in front of a file
to indicate that CSRG_BASED applied, a - that I don't think it's the case
and a * where I'll have to look further into it.

CSRG_BASED

I skipped the ocurrences of utmpx.h, because I haven't looked into the status
on utmpx in OpenBSD, but it is present in NetBSD -> http://80386.nl/unix/utmpx/

+ I did change an __FreeBSD__ identifier to CSRG_BASED
- I didn't (so more work has probably to be done on NetBSD compatibility here)
* Needs more time looking into, but looks replaceable on first glance

+ programs/dtappbuilder/src/abmf/write_c.c -> but debatable:
It seems OpenBSD does have va_copy in stdarg.h, so
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=va_copy&sektion=3
__va_copy is a GNU extension, so it seems more sensible to use va_copy instead
va_copy is a standard C99 feature. Using this would one day have been controversial, 
but since GCC 3.0 even the GNU coding standards allwo relying on C99 features.

	Line 353:
	#if defined(__ppc) || defined(linux)  || defined(__OpenBSD__)
	#define va_start_params() __va_copy(params, va_params)
	#elif defined(__FreeBSD__)
	#define va_start_params() va_copy(params, va_params)
	#else
	#define va_start_params() (params = va_params)
	#endif
