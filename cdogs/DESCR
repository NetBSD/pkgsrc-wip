C-Dogs SDL is a port of the classic DOS arcade game C-Dogs to modern operating
systems utilising the SDL Media Libraries.
C-Dogs is an arcade shoot-em-up which lets players work alone and co-operativly
during missions, and against each other in the "dogfight" deathmatch mode.
Several built-in missions and dogfight maps are included.
The author of the DOS version of C-Dogs was Ronny Wester.
