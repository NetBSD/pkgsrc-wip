[Centrifuge] is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid,
accurate and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on
desktop computers. The system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the
Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized
specifically for the metagenomic classification problem.
