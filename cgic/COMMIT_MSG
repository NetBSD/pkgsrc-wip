(www/cgic) Updated 2.06 to 2.08

What's new in version 2.08?

Beginning with version 2.08, `cgic` offers more options when setting
cookies. To enhance security, the following options can be used when
setting a cookie:

  * Secure
  * HttpOnly
  * SameSite=Strict

The new function cgiHeaderCookieSet allows you to set these
options. The function cgiHeaderCookieSetString is kept for
compatibility reasons.

What's new in version 2.07?

Per a suggestion by Geoff Mulligan, cgic now tolerates keys without a
value in URL-encoded GET and POST submissions. Although the HTML5 spec
discourages it, there are existing systems in the wild that do leave
the `=` off entirely if the value is an empty string. Beginning with
version 2.07, `cgic` handles this as you'd expect: you get an entry
with the corresponding key and an empty string as the value. A simple
unit test compilation target was also added, to test this feature and
rule out side effects.
