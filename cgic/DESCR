This is the code written to accompany Thomas Boutell's book "CGI
Programming in C & Perl".  It provides a library of routines for use
in CGI programming, and unlike cgilib-0.5, this library handles the
"multipart/form-data" encoding required to use the FILE input control
type as defined in the HTML specification.

NOTE: It should be aware that there were a few developer visible changes
made from Thomas Boutell's original distribution when integrating it
with the NetBSD packages environment.  They are:

1) Instead of being yet another source file which is used in building
   the application, the package have been converted totally into a
   library format.  This library is linked using "-lcgic".
2) As a result of the first item, the developer no longer writes their
   entry point under the function name of cgiMain().  Instead, the
   user will provide their own main(), and will need to call cgiInit()
   before any other cgic function is called.
