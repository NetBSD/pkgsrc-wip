# Chirp does not have what would normally called releasees.  They have
# "daily builds" which are like releases except that:
#   they are called chirp-daily instead of chirp
#   they have YYYYMMDD version numbers
#   they don't have the usual release testing
#   the python3 version is chirp-next (which is also daily)
# Upstream says
#    they will not go back to regular version numbers
#    the preferred name is chirp, not chirp-daily
