This is a utility to reset the password of any user that has a valid local
account on your Windows system.

It supports all Windows from NT3.5 to Win8.1, also 64 bit and also the Server
versions (like 2003, 2008, 2012)

Knowing the old password is not needed to set a new one.

It will detect and offer to unlock locked or disabled out user accounts!

There is also a registry editor and other registry utilities that works under
linux/unix, and can be used for other things than password editing.
