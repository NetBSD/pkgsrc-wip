Chora is our tool for viewing code repositories that are managed using the
CVS source control system. It aims to provide a high degree of integration
with CVS and the other Horde web-based tools.

Right now, Chora comes close to matching existing CVS-Web scripts feature
for feature, and provides a solid base for future development. Some exciting
new features include a visual branch viewing tool, which intelligently
displays the branch history of a given file. Branches have traditionally
been a source of confusion when using CVS, and this feature aims to make it
a bit clearer and easier to use.
