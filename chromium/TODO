To Do:

1) If pulseaudio not run, chromium can't start it, so no sound:
VERBOSE1:pulse_util.cc(261)] Failed to connect to the context. Error: Connection refused
WARNING:audio_manager_linux.cc(53)] Falling back to ALSA for audio output. PulseAudio is not available or could not be initialized.

If pulseaudio already started, chromium can join it, and has sound.
This is the workaround, see the files/chrome launch wrapper.

NOTE: OpenBSD (of course), FreeBSD and DragonFly use sndio as default.

2) HID doesn't work on NetBSD.
NOTE: For this OpenBSD uses fido and libudev-openbsd, FreeBSD uses devd.
