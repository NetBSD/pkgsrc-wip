To Do:

0) Build on NetBSD-10 amd64

1) Audio backends
 a) NetBSD uses sunaudio (https://github.com/kikadf/chromium-audioio)
 b) FreeBSD uses pulseaudio

If pulseaudio not run, chromium can't start it, so no sound:
VERBOSE1:pulse_util.cc(261)] Failed to connect to the context. Error: Connection refused
WARNING:audio_manager_linux.cc(53)] Falling back to ALSA for audio output. PulseAudio is not available or could not be initialized.

If pulseaudio already started, chromium can join it, and has sound.
This is the workaround, see the files/chromium.sh.in launch wrapper.

2) HID doesn't work on NetBSD.
NOTE: For this OpenBSD uses libudev-openbsd, FreeBSD uses devd.
