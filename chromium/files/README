Some notes on chromium:

1) Wrapper flags support
  The startup wrapper can read chromium flags
  from ~/.config/chromium-flags.conf.
  Example settings in chromium-flags.conf:
    CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--disable-gpu --enable-foo"

2) Disabling WebAssembly
  WebAssembly is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by either:
  - Setting CHROMIUM_ENABLE_WASM=0 in your environment, or
  - Adding the following flags to ~/.config/chromium-flags.conf:
    --disable-features=WebAssembly,AsmJsToWebAssembly,WebAssemblyStreaming
    --js-flags=--noexpose-wasm

3) Random tab hang
  Under investigation. No known working workaround.

4) HID support
  To enable monitoring attached and detached FIDO devices on NetBSD,
  you should enable the ndevd service (a devpubd drop-in replacement)
  in /etc/rc.conf.
