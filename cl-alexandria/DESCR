Alexandria is a project and a library for Common Lisp systems.

As a project Alexandria's goal is to reduce duplication of effort and improve
portability of Common Lisp code according to its own idiosyncratic and rather
conservative aesthetic. What this actually means is open to debate, but each
project member has a veto on all project activities, so a degree of
conservativism is inevitable.

As a library Alexandria is one of the means by which the project strives for
its goals. Alexandria is a collection of portable public domain utilities.
