Anaphoric macros provide implicit bindings for various operations. Extensive
use of anaphoric macros is not good style, and probably makes you go blind as
well - there's a reason why Anaphora claims to be from Hell.

Anaphora provides two families of anphoric macros, which can be identified by
their names and packages (both families are also exported from the package
ANAPHORA). The implicitly-bound symbol ANAPHORA:IT is also exported from all
three packages.
