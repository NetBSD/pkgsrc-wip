CL-FAD (for "Files and Directories") is a thin layer atop Common Lisp's
standard pathname functions. It is intended to provide some unification between
current CL implementations on Windows, OS X, Linux, and Unix. Most of the code
was written by Peter Seibel for his book Practical Common Lisp.

CL-FAD comes with a BSD-style license so you can basically do with it whatever
you want.
