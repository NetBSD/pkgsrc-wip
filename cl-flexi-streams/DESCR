FLEXI-STREAMS implements "virtual" bivalent streams that can be layered atop
real binary or bivalent streams and that can be used to read and write
character data in various single- or multi-octet encodings which can be changed
on the fly. It also supplies in-memory binary streams which are similar to
string streams.

The library needs a Common Lisp implementation that supports Gray streams and
relies on David Lichteblau's trivial-gray-streams to offer portability between
different Lisps.

The code comes with a BSD-style license so you can basically do with it
whatever you want.
