CL-WHO - Yet another Lisp markup language

CL-WHO tries to create efficient code in that it makes constant strings as long
as possible. In other words, the code generated by the CL-WHO macros will
usually be a sequence of WRITE-STRING forms for constant parts of the output
interspersed with arbitrary code inserted by the user of the macro. CL-WHO will
make sure that there aren't two adjacent WRITE-STRING forms with constant
strings - see examples below. CL-WHO's output is either XHTML (default) or
'plain' (SGML) HTML depending on what you've set HTML-MODE to.
