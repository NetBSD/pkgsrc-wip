clamav: update to 1.4.3
main changes since 0.103.12:

Added support for extracting ALZ archives. The new ClamAV file type for
ALZ archives is CL_TYPE_ALZ. Added a DCONF option to enable or disable
ALZ archive support.

    Tip: DCONF (Dynamic CONFiguration) is a feature that allows for some
	configuration changes to be made via ClamAV .cfg "signatures".

Added support for extracting LHA/LZH archives. The new ClamAV file type
for LHA/LZH archives is CL_TYPE_LHA_LZH. Added a DCONF option to enable
or disable LHA/LZH archive support.

Added the ability to disable image fuzzy hashing, if needed. For context,
image fuzzy hashing is a detection mechanism useful for identifying malware
by matching images included with the malware or phishing email/document.

New ClamScan options:

--scan-image[=yes(*)/no]
--scan-image-fuzzy-hash[=yes(*)/no]

New ClamD config options:

ScanImage yes(*)/no
ScanImageFuzzyHash yes(*)/no

New libclamav scan options:

options.parse &= ~CL_SCAN_PARSE_IMAGE;
options.parse &= ~CL_SCAN_PARSE_IMAGE_FUZZY_HASH;

    Added a DCONF option to enable or disable image fuzzy hashing support.

Added support for extracting and scanning attachments found in Microsoft
OneNote section files. OneNote parsing will be enabled by default, but may
be optionally disabled using one of the following options:
a. The clamscan command line option: --scan-onenote=no,
b. The clamd.conf config option: ScanOneNote no,
c. The libclamav scan option options.parse &= ~CL_SCAN_PARSE_ONENOTE;,
d.  A signature change to the daily.cfg dynamic configuration (DCONF).

Added support for extracting Universal Disk Format (UDF) partitions.
Specifically, this version adds support for the
Beginning Extended Area Descriptor (BEA01) type of UDF files.

Added an option to customize the size of ClamAV's clean file cache.
Increasing the size of the clean file cache may improve scan performance but
will require more RAM. The cache size value should be a square number or
will be rounded up to the nearest square number.
The cache size option for clamd and clamscan is --cache-size. Alternatively,
you can customize the cache size for ClamD by setting CacheSize in clamd.conf.

Raised the MaxScanSize limit so the total amount of data scanned when
scanning a file or archive may exceed 4 gigabytes.
Introduced the ability to suffix the MaxScanSize and other config file size
options with a "G" or "g" for the number of gigabytes. For example,
for ClamD you may now specify MaxScanSize 10G in clamd.conf. And for ClamScan,
you may now specify --max-scansize=10g.
The MaxFileSize is still limited internally in ClamAV to 2 gigabytes.
Any file, or embedded file, larger than 2GB will be skipped. You may use
clamscan --alert-exceeds-max, or the clamd.conf option AlertExceedsMax yes
to tell if a scan is not completed because of the scan limits.

Added ability for Freshclam to use a client certificate PEM file
and a private key PEM file for authentication to a private mirror by
setting the following environment variables:

    FRESHCLAM_CLIENT_CERT: May be set to the path of a file (PEM)
    containing the client certificate.
    FRESHCLAM_CLIENT_KEY: May be set to the path of a file (PEM)
    containing the client private key.
    FRESHCLAM_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWD: May be set to a password for the client
    key PEM file, if it is password protected.

Added the ability to extract images embedded in HTML CSS <style> blocks.

Updated to Sigtool so that the --vba option will extract VBA code
from Microsoft Office documents the same way that libclamav extracts VBA.
This resolves several issues where Sigtool could not extract VBA.
Sigtool will also now display the normalized VBA code instead of the
pre-normalized VBA code.

Added a new ClamScan and ClamD option: --fail-if-cvd-older-than=days.
Additionally, we introduce FailIfCvdOlderThan as a clamd.conf synonym
for --fail-if-cvd-older-than. When passed, it causes ClamD to exit on
startup with a non-zero return code if the virus database is older than
the specified number of days.

Added a new function cl_cvdgetage() to the libclamav API. This function
will retrieve the age in seconds of the youngest file in a database directory,
or the age of a single CVD (or CLD) file.

Added a new function cl_engine_set_clcb_vba() to the libclamav API. Use this
function to set a cb_vba callback function. The cb_vba callback function will
be run whenever VBA is extracted from office documents. The provided data will
be a normalized copy of the extracted VBA. This callback was added to support
Sigtool so that it can use the same VBA extraction logic that ClamAV uses to
scan documents.

Support for decrypting read-only OLE2-based XLS files that are encrypted
with the default password. Use of the default password will now appear in
the metadata JSON.

Overhauled the implementation of the all-match feature. The newer code is
more reliable and easier to maintain.
This project fixed several known issues with signature detection in
all- match mode:
	Enabled embedded file-type recognition signatures to match when
	    a malware signature also matched in a scan of the same layer.
	Enabled bytecode signatures to run in all-match mode after a match
	    has occurred.
	Fixed an assortment of all-match edge case issues.
	Added multiple test cases to verify correct all-match behavior.

Increased the default limits for file-size and scan-size:

    MaxScanSize: 100M -> 400M
    MaxFileSize: 25M -> 100M
    StreamMaxLength: 25M -> 100M
    PCREMaxFileSize: 25M -> 100M
    MaxEmbeddedPE: 10M -> 40M
    MaxHTMLNormalize: 10M -> 40M
    MaxScriptNormalize: 5M -> 20M
    MaxHTMLNoTags: 2M -> 8M

Added image fuzzy hash subsignatures for logical signatures.
Image fuzzy hash subsignatures are a new feature for detecting images known
to be used in phishing campaigns or otherwise used when distributing malware.
