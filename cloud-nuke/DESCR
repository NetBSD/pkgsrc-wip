cloud-nuke is a CLI tool to delete all resources in an AWS account.

cloud-nuke was created for situations when you might have an account
you use for testing and need to clean up leftover resources so you're
not charged for them. Also great for cleaning out accounts with
redundant resources. Also great for removing unnecessary defaults like
default VPCs and permissive ingress/egress rules in default security
groups.
