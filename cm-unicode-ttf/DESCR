Computer Modern Unicode fonts were converted from metafont sources
using mftrace with autotrace backend and fontforge. Some characters
in several fonts are copied from Blue Sky type 1 fonts released by
AMS. Their main purpose is to create free good quality fonts for
use in X applications supporting many languages. Currently the fonts
contain glyphs from Latin (Metafont ec, tc, vnr), Cyrillic (lh),
Greek (cbgreek when available) code sets and IPA extensions (from
tipa).  Other alphabets are also welcome.
