CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build
process in an operating system and compiler independent manner. Unlike
many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in
conjunction with the native build environment. Simple configuration
files placed in each source directory (called CMakeLists.txt files)
are used to generate standard build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix and
projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) which are used in the usual
way. CMake can compile source code, create libraries, generate
wrappers, and build executables in arbitrary combinations. CMake
supports in-place and out-of-place builds, and can therefore support
multiple builds from a single source tree. CMake also supports static
and dynamic library builds.  Another nice feature of CMake is that it
generates a cache file that is designed to be used with a graphical
editor.  For example, when CMake runs, it locates include files,
libraries, and executable, and may encounter optional build
directives. This information is gathered into the cache, which may be
changed by the user prior to the generation of the native build files.
