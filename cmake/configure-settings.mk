# This file handles packages that use CMake as their primary build
# system. For more information about CMake, see http://www.cmake.org/.
#
# Package-settable variables:
#
# CMAKE_MODULE_PATH_OVERRIDE
#	Deprecated
#	A list of files relative to WRKSRC in which the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
#	variable is adjusted to include the path from the pkgsrc wrappers.
#	The file ${WRKSRC}/CMakeLists.txt is always appended to this list.
#
# CMAKE_PKGSRC_BUILD_FLAGS
#	If set to yes, disable compiler optimization flags associated
#	with the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE setting (for pkgsrc these come in from
#	the user via variables like CFLAGS).  The default is yes, but you can
#	set it to no for pkgsrc packages that do not use a compiler to avoid
#	cmake "Manually-specified variables were not used by the project"
#	warnings associated with this variable.
#
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#	A list of directories to add the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH cmake variable.
#	If a package installs its contents in ${PREFIX}/package instead of
#	${PREFIX} and it installs cmake modules there
#	"CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH += ${PREFIX}/package" should be in its
#	buildlink3.mk so that packages that depend on it can find its
#	cmake modules if they use cmake to build.
#
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
#	Like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH but just for include files.
#
# CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
#	Like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH but just for libraries.
#
# CMAKE_USE_GNU_INSTALL_DIRS
#	If set to yes, set GNU standard installation directories with pkgsrc
#	configured settings.  The default is yes.
#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
#	Destination directory to install software. The default is ${PREFIX}.
#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
#       Destination directory to install shlibs, used by
#       install_name_tool(1) on macOS. The default is ${PREFIX}/lib.
#
