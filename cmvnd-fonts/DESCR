This package includes a set of bitmap fonts derived from the
the artwiz-fonts collection. These fonts are rather small
and make a good fit for old CRTs and lower display resolutions.

Included fonts are:

* lime: improved version of artwiz-lime with better kerning, distinct
  characters, extended unicode support, Powerline compatibility, and
  in-built icon characters.
* antidote: artwiz-cure mod with lemon-like characters.
* uushi monaco mod.
* limey: artwiz-lime mod by @spectrum that served as the basis for
  lemon.
* berry: monaco mod by @spectrum, with the addition of a Bold variant.
