This utility allows you to access Unbound statistics from collectd
using the exec plugin. It hasn't been thoroughly tested, use it at
your own risk...

Once the collectd-unbound binary is compiled, copy it wherever you
want and add the following lines to you collectd configuration:

LoadPlugin exec
<Plugin "exec">
    Exec "unbound" "/usr/pkg/bin/collectd-unbound"
</Plugin>

Note: the utility executes the command unbound-control stats to
fetch the statistics: make sure the user specified in your exec
plugin block has the permissions to execute the command.
