The UCL common multimedia library implements a number of algorithms
and protocols needed by a number of our applications. It compiles
standalone on a range of Unix systems (Solaris, Linux, Irix, FreeBSD,
MacOSX) and on Windows 95/98/NT/XP.

The following protocols/algorithms are included in the library:

    * Base64 encoding/decoding
    * Binary tree
    * Random number
    * HMAC authentication
    * MD5
    * DES
    * RTP
    * MBus
    * SAP
    * SDP
