Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software
-------------------------------------------

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color
and gray-scale images.

The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and
image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.  The
core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable C code;
we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

Note: This package is intended to crosscompile jpeg for i386 on x86_64
