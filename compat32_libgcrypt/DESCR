This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG.
It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric ciphers
(AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5,
RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key
algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions, random numbers and a
lot of supporting functions.
