Please beware that the Kerberized r-services, telnetd and ftpd services and
the related client applications are no longer included in this package.
They are now found in security/mit-krb5-appl.

Also to interoperate with older kerberos realms, you may need to set
  allow_weak_crypto = true
in the [libdefaults] section of your krb5.conf file
