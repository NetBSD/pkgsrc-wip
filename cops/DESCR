Welcome! This is a quick intro to COPS (Computer Oracle and Password System.)
COPS is a collection of security tools that are designed specifically to aid
the typical UNIX systems administrator, programmer, operator, or consultant
in the oft neglected area of computer security.

The package can be broken down into three key parts. The first is the actual
set of programs that attempt to automate security checks that are often
performed manually (or perhaps with self written short shell scripts or
programs) by a systems administrator. The second part is the documentation,
which details how to set up, operate, and to interpret any results given by
the programs. Finally, COPS is an evolving beast. It includes a list of
possible extensions that might appear in future releases, as well as pointers
to other works in UNIX security that could not be included at this time, due
to space or other restrictions.
