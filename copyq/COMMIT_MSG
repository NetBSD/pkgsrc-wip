x11/copyq: update to 11.0.0

* Added
- Adds support for dark/light window title scheme.
- New frameless_window option (#2570) toggles the main
  window frame and title bar (if supported by the window manager):
   copyq toggleConfig frameless_window
- Adds support for localizing command names in the command INI files (#3032):
   [Command]
   Name = ...
   Name_cs = ...
   Name_fr = ...
   Name_pt_BR = ...
   Name_pt = ...
- Adds support for showing preview for more image formats (namely ico and webp).
- Adds support for more complex network requests in scripts. New NetworkRequest
  class can be used to set custom headers, HTTP method, number of allowed
  redirects and timeout.

* Changed
- Avoids hiding the main window on backspace (#3107).
- Enables Vi/Emacs navigation (#3012) in menus, and Ctrl+[ in Vi and Ctrl+G in
  Emacs to work in many other places as Esc key (for example, to hide menus, 
  dialogs). Users can override shortcuts, but not some reserved ones in specific
  cases (mainly, if the item list or a menu has focus).
- Selections and current items/rows/data in scripts now only relate to the tab
  selected with tab(...) in scripts (this is still by default the selected tab
  when the command started). Affected script functions:
   move()
   setData()
   removeData()
   selectedItems()
   selectedItemData()
   setSelectedItemData()
   setSelectedItemsData()
   currentItem()
   ItemSelection().current()
- Drops unnecessary timeouts when executing commands and actions from scripts.
- Avoids fetching and passing clipboard to action()/execute() if the commands
  do not contains %1 placeholder. This can improve performance.

* Fixed
- Fixes dialog(): custom size, layout and resizing (#3003).
- Fixes overriding filter/search string with filter() (previously the new value
  was appended to the current filter).
- Fixes refocusing the item after editing its notes.
- Synchronize plugin: Fixes missing data in the last item when tab is full.
- Windows: Fixes the icon for uninstaller (#2864).
- Fixes build for Qt 6.9 and above.
- Fixes potentially misconfigured log file path at app start (#3087).
- Linux: Avoids auto-hiding the main window when moved on some window managers
  (#3119).
