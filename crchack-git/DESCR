crchack is a public domain tool to force CRC checksums of input
messages to arbitrarily chosen values. The main advantage over
existing CRC alteration tools is the ability to obtain the target
checksum by changing non-contiguous input bits. Furthermore, crchack
supports all CRC algorithms including custom CRC parameters. crchack
is also an arbitrary-precision CRC calculator.
