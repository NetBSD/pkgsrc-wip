Cream is a configuration of the famous Vim text editor that makes it
easier to use, like an Apple- or Windows-style text editor. It uses
Vim's own extensibility to improve menus, keyboard shortcuts, and
editing behavior. Cream seamlessly maintains Vim's insertmode to access
all the power of the original Vim plus many custom Cream extensions.
