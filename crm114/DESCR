CRM114 is a system to examine incoming e-mail, system log streams,
data files or other data streams, and to sort, filter, or alter
the incoming files or data streams according to the user's wildest
desires. Criteria for categorization of data can be by satisfaction
of regexes, by sparse binary polynomial matching with a Bayesian
Chain Rule evaluator, a Hidden Markov Model, or by other means.
Accuracy of the SBPH/BCR classifier has been seen in excess of 99
per cent, for 1/4 megabyte of learning text. In other words, CRM114
learns, and it learns fast .

CRM114 is compatible with SpamAssassin or other spam-flagging
software; it can also be pipelined in front of or behind procmail.
CRM114 is also useful as a syslog or firewall log filter, to alert
you to important events but ignore the ones that aren't meaningful.

This package tracks the "Cutting Edge Version".
