"cronolog" is a simple program that reads log messages from its input
and writes them to a set of output files, the names of which are
constructed using template and the current date and time.  The
template uses the same format specifiers as the Unix date command
(which are the same as the standard C strftime library function).

"cronolog" is intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server, such
as Apache to split the access log into daily or monthly logs.
