WARNING

This version of CROPSR (v0.0.0.44) apparently has serious internal
bugs.  For example, while the internal test case can be replicated by
running the program on the sample data provided, most predicted
binding sites lack the appopriate constraints, i.e., an adjacent NGG
sequence.

Upstream has been notified and have potentially fixed the bugs.  As a
result, this package will be updated when those fixes have been
verified.
