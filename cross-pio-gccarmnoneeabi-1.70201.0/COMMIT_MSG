cross-pio-gccarmnoneeabi-1.70201.0 is the packages/toolchain for
platformio/platform-espressif32 and is for the esp32 arm processors.  It
nneeds to be referenced in your local .platformio installation tree at
.platformio/packages/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.70201.0

Currently I don't know how to set this up to build and could use
some help here.
