Crosstool-NG aims at building toolchains. Toolchains are an essential
component in a software development project. It will compile,
assemble and link the code that is being developed. Some pieces of
the toolchain will eventually end up in the resulting binaries:
static libraries are but an example.

Refer to (http://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/) for more information
on how to configure, install and use crosstool-NG.
