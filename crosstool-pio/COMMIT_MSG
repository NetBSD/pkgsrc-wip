# Crosstool-NG

## Introduction

Crosstool-NG aims at building toolchains. Toolchains are an essential
component in a software development project. It will compile, assemble and
link the code that is being developed. Some pieces of the toolchain will
eventually end up in the resulting binaries:  static libraries are but an
example.

**Before reporting a bug**, please read [bug reporting
guidelines](http://crosstool-ng.github.io/support/). Bugs that do not provide
the required information will be closed without explanation.

Refer to [documentation at crosstool-NG
website](http://crosstool-ng.github.io/docs/) for more information on how to
configure, install and use crosstool-NG.

**Note 1:** If you elect to build a uClibc-based toolchain, you will have to
prepare a config file for uClibc with <= crosstool-NG-1.21.0.  In >=
crosstool-NG-1.22.0 you only need to prepare a config file for uClibc(or
uClibc-ng) if you really need a custom config for uClibc.

**Note 2:** If you call `ct-ng --help` you will get help for `make(2)`. This
is because ct-ng is in fact a `make(2)` script.  There is no clean workaround
for this.
