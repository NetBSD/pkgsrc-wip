CsvMode, csv-mode, is a package by FrancisJWright for editing comma
separated value files (.csv).

The commands include sorting numerically or alphabetically on a
particular field, cutting and pasting columns of fields, padding to
align fields, or removing padding.

The default format used is a comma separator (,) and double quotes
("") for field quoting. This can be customized, for instance with a
different separator for European locales (where a comma is a decimal
point).
