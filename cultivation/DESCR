Cultivation is a game about a community of gardeners growing food
for themselves in a shared space.

Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social
simulation, and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant
resources---there is no shooting, but there are plenty of angry
looks. It is also an evolution simulation. Within the world of
Cultivation, you can explore a virtually infinite spectrum of
different plant and gardener varieties.
