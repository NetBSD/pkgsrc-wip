CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed
by Apple Inc. for Mac OS X and other UNIX-like operating systems.
CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") and provides System
V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a web interface, and a C
API to manage printers and print jobs.

This distribution contains backends, filters, and other software
that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer
maintained by Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters
and software developed independently of Apple, especially filters
for the PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting
and a daemon to browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers
and makes these printers available locally.

From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for using printer
drivers with CUPS under Linux. With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this
package can be used optionally to switch over to PDF-based printing.
In that case some filters are provided by both CUPS and this package.
Then the filters of this package should be used.
