.Sh NAME
.Nm cvs2git
.Nd convert CVS repository to git
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar fixup-sql-script
.Op Fl m Ar mailmap
.Op Fl s Ar merge-limit-seconds
.Ar source
.Ar destination
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script to convert a
.Xr cvs 1
repository to
.Xr git 1
using
.Xr cvs2fossil 1
and
.Xr git 1 .
.Pp
.Ar source
must be a CVS repository (the server side, i.e. the RCS files, not a
checkout).
.Nm
will create
.Ar destination Ns Pa .fossil
(the fossil conversion created by
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 ) .
.Xr fossil 1
will create a
.Xr git 1
fast-import file
.Ar destination Ns Pa .fossil.export
which will be converted into the git repository
.Ar destination Ns Pa .git
by
.Xr git 1.
.Xr git 1
will also be used to update the author information using a mailmap
file, if provided.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl m Ar mailmap
Pass a
.Xr git 1
mailmap file for creating proper author information using
.Xr git-filter-repo 1 .
The mailmap format is described in
.Xr gitmailmap 5 .
.It Fl f Ar fixup-sql-script
Pass an SQL fixup script for
.Xr cvs2fossil 1
for its
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl s Ar merge-limit-seconds
Pass a merge time limit in seconds to
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To convert the
.Nx
src repository, if you have developer access, do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export REPO=src
export LOGIN=username
rsync -aS --delete -e ssh "$LOGIN"@cvs.NetBSD.org::cvsroot/"$REPO" "$REPO"-rsync
cvs2git -m mailmap -s 300 "$REPO"-rsync/"$REPO" "$REPO"
.Ed
.Pp
The conversion output is in
.Pa src.git .
The intermediate fossil directory is
.Pa src.fossil
and the corresponsing fast-import file
.Pa src.fossil.export .
If you use
.Fl a
there will be another
.Pa src.git.old
directory, respectively.
You can delete them after the conversion.
