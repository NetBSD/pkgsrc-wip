.Sh NAME
.Nm cvs2hg
.Nd convert CVS repository to Mercurial
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl m Ar mailmap
.Ar source
.Ar destination
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script to convert a
.Xr cvs 1
repository to
.Xr hg 1
using
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 ,
.Xr git 1 ,
and
.Xr hg 1 .
.Pp
.Ar source
must be a CVS repository (the server side, i.e. the RCS files, not a
checkout).
.Nm
will create
.Ar destination Ns Pa .fossil
(the fossil conversion created by
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 ) ,
.Ar destination Ns Pa .git
(the git conversion created via the
.Xr git 1
fast-import file exported by
.Xr fossil 1 ) ,
and finally
.Ar destination Ns Pa .hg ,
the Mercurial repository created from the git one by
.Xr hg 1 .
.Pp
You can pass a
.Xr gitmailmap 5
file for creating proper author information using the
.Fl m
flag.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To convert the NetBSD src repository, if you have developer access, do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export REPO=src
export LOGIN=username
rsync -aS --delete -e ssh "$LOGIN"@cvs.NetBSD.org::cvsroot/"$REPO" "$REPO"-rsync
cvs2hg -m .mailmap "$REPO"-rsync/"$REPO" "$REPO"
.Ed
where
.Pa .mailmap
consists of lines like this:
.Bd -literal
Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org> <wiz>
.Ed
.Pp
The conversion is in
.Pa src.hg .
The intermediate fossil and git directories are
.Pa src.fossil
and
.Pa src.git ,
respectively.
You can delete them after the conversion.
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to provide an
.Pa authormap
file to convert Unix user names to email addresses.
