.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a script to convert a
.Xr cvs 1
repository to
.Xr hg 1
using
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 ,
.Xr git 1 ,
and
.Xr hg 1 .
.Pp
.Ar source
must be a CVS repository (the server side, i.e. the RCS files, not a
checkout).
.Nm
will create
.Ar destination Ns Pa .fossil
(the fossil conversion created by
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 ) ,
.Ar destination Ns Pa .git
(the git conversion created via the
.Xr git 1
fast-import file exported by
.Xr fossil 1 ) ,
and finally
.Ar destination Ns Pa .hg ,
the Mercurial repository created from the git one by
.Xr hg 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl a Ar mailmap
Pass a
.Xr hg 1
authormap file for creating proper author information using
.Xr hg 1 Cm convert .
The file should consist of lines of the format:
.Dl login=Full Name <email@address>
.It Fl f Ar fixup-sql-script
Pass an SQL fixup script for
.Xr cvs2fossil 1
for its
.Fl f
flag.
.It Fl m Ar mailmap
Pass a
.Xr gitmailmap 5
file for creating proper author information using
.Xr git-filter-repo 1 .
The file chould consist of lines of the format:
.Dl Full Name <email@address> <login>
.It Fl s Ar merge-limit-seconds
Pass a merge time limit in seconds to
.Xr cvs2fossil 1 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To convert the
.Nx
src repository, if you have developer access, do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export REPO=src
export LOGIN=username
rsync -aS --delete -e ssh "$LOGIN"@cvs.NetBSD.org::cvsroot/"$REPO" "$REPO"-rsync
cvs2hg -a authormap "$REPO"-rsync/"$REPO" "$REPO"
.Ed
.Pp
The conversion output is in
.Pa src.hg .
The intermediate fossil and git directories are
.Pa src.fossil
and
.Pa src.git ,
respectively.
If you use
.Fl a
or
.Fl m
there will be another
.Pa src.hg.old
or
.Pa src.git.old
directory, respectively.
You can delete them after the conversion.
