To setup your shiny new CVSUp mirror:

 * Make a symlink within %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/collections for
   directiory ../ -> NetBSD-distrib.self/

   e.g., % cd /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/collections && ln -s ../ ./NetBSD-distrib.self

 * Make a symlink within %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/collections for
   directory /export/foo -> -> ./NetBSD.cvs

   e.g., % cd %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/collections &&
	ln -s /export/netbsd/cvs ./NetBSD-distrib.self

 * NOTE: This package ships with a NetBSD client CVSUP supfile that
   will fetch the "Self" repository from cvsup.jp.netbsd.org; these
   sup files will reference CVS Repo in path /home/cvsroot ; please
   ensure that this directory is also symlink'd the path of your CVS
   repository such as the /export/foo above.

 * Make sure you have two POSIX [user:group] pairs setup, normally:
   [cvsupin:cvsupin] to run the upgrade script and own all CVS
   repositories, and [cvsup:cvsup] to run the cvsupd(8) service daemon.

 * Setup your cvsupd(8) configuration in rc.conf(5), by default it will
   serve known collections listed in %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/sup which will
   be populated by the initial manual synchronization

 * Run an initial manual synchronization:

   e.g., %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd

 * Setup a cronjob schedule agreeable to your bandwidth such as:

   15 0-12,14-23 * * * /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd -s
   15 13 * * * /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd # run it 1/day w/o scanfiles

 * Monitor your mirror for freshness!
