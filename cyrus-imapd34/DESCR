IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc). The Cyrus
IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
is generally intended to be run on "sealed" servers, where normal users
are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of
the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user
access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

From version 3 on, the Cyrus IMAP server also offers the option of
serving calendars and address books via a CalDAV / CardDAV interface.
The information is stored in special directories in the same location
that is used for the emails. This makes Cyrus IMAP a self-contained
groupware server.

Cyrus IMAP 3.4.x is the latest version that can directly upgrade an
existing server that is older than 3.0.x. If you want to upgrade to
3.6.x or 3.8.x (or later), you will need to upgrade through version
3.2.10 or later. This package should work.
