The latest cyrus-imapd package in pkgsrc currently is in the 2.4.x series.
In order to upgrade to 3.8.x (the latest stable series), it is necessary
to upgrade through 3.2.x, 3.4.x, or 3.6.x. But the 3.6.x series and later
have dropped support for upgrading from prior to 3.0.x. So, we need a 3.2.x
or 3.4.x series package as an intermediate step. This package aims to fill
that need.

Done:

- Built based on mp@petermann-it.de's work in wip on the cyrus-imapd30
  and cyrus-imapd36 packages.
- Tested on a SmartOS (Illumos) dev system and then a system with active
  users with various clients. Tested configurations included Kerberos and
  sasldb authentication and tcp_wrappers support.

Next steps:

- Is it possible to obtain cyrus.conf and imapd.conf from the work
  directory work/.destdir/opt/local/share/examples/cyrus-imapd instead
  of having identical copies in files?
- Consider mving binaries from /opt/local/{bin,sbin,libexec} to
  /opt/local/cyrus, as cyrus-imapd24 does.
- cyradm script ends up with the #!/build/dir/.tools/bin/sh as the
  interpreter path, which doesn't work.
- ./configure ends up with an argument:
  -htmldir=/var/tmp/pkgsrc-build/wip/cyrus-imapd34/work/.destdir/opt/local/share/doc/cyrus-imapd
- ./configure ends up with both --without-sqlite and --with-sqline=/opt/local
- Make sure the package creates the cyrus user
- Add SMF config

Bugs:

- Kerberos support, PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not tested
