DXX-Rebirth is based on the late D1X and D2X source ports (which,
in turn, were based on the original Descent source and LDescent).
The Rebirth Team has spent a lot of time working to improve the
source code by fixing old bugs and adding some improvements, while
always staying true to our philosophy: Keep it Descent!

It is the goal of DXX-Rebirth to keep Descent 1 & 2 alive and well,
updating them for modern PCs while also keeping them the same games
you remember playing back in 1995!

This is the Descent 2 source port. The data files are not included.
