* Improve DESCR ?
* Improve the do-install target ?
* Would we apply the patch of freenode ?

- The package does not handle PKG_SYSCONFDIR correctly:
    1) Configuration files must be in share/examples/dancer-ircd, not with
       documentation.
    2) Example files must be registered in the PLIST.
    3) The Makefile must not touch PKG_SYSCONFDIR directly (it does with an
       ${INSTALL_DATA}).
    4) Adjust CONF_FILES properly.  It points to an unexistant file.
