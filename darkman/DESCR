darkman
=======

A framework for dark-mode and light-mode transitions on Unix-like desktops.

## Introduction

`darkman` runs in the background and turns on dark mode at sundown, and turns it off
again at sunrise. `darkman` is not designed to be used interactively: it's designed to
be set up once, and run in the background.

At sundown, it will look for scripts in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/dark-mode.d/`.
At sunrise, it will look for scripts in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/light-mode.d/`.

These scripts individually configure different components and applications.

Sample and reference scripts are included in the `examples` directory, and
further contributions for specific applications or environments are welcome.

The complete documentation is included as a man page and is also [available
