For pkgsrc installations, DAViCal's package is installed in non-default
locations:

	Document root:		${DAVICALDIR}/htdocs
	Configuration files:	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/*-conf.php

To complete the installation of DAViCal, follow these steps:

1. Create DAViCal's app (application) and dba (database admin) acounts:

	$ su pgsql
	$ createuser -D -R -S --pwprompt davical_app
	<enter davical_app passwd>
	$ createuser -D -R -S --pwprompt davical_dba
	<enter davical_dba passwd>

2. Edit pg_hba.conf file to add the davical_dba and davical_app users

	local   davical     davical_app   md5
	local   davical     davical_dba   md5

3. Create DAViCal's database

       su pgsql ${DAVICALDIR}/dba/create-database.sh

4. You will need to make DAViCal accessible through your HTTP server.
   If you are running Apache and ap-php, adapt DAViCal's configuration
   file to your setup

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   When finished, you can add an Include directive directly within Apache
   configuration file:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   then restart Apache.

5. You should now be able to access DAViCal through the URL configured
   within DAViCal's configuration file. By default, it resides under

	http://<your_webserver>/davical/

   Follow the steps indicated there.

Please refer to the following file if you need further information
regarding DAViCal's installation.
