dblab is a fast and lightweight interactive terminal based UI
application for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3, written in Go and
works on OSX, Linux and Windows machines. Main idea behind using
Go for backend development is to utilize ability of the compiler
to produce zero-dependency binaries for multiple platforms. dblab
was created as an attempt to build very simple and portable
application to work with local or remote
PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite3/Oracle/SQL Server databases.
