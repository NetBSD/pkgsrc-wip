D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms
of complexity.

D-BUS supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus decreasing
latency), authentication, and more.  It is designed to be low-overhead;
messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using XML.  D-BUS also
supports a method call mapping for its messages, but it is not required;
this makes using the system quite simple.

This package provides the D-BUS core library and daemon, as well as
some utilities that complement it.
