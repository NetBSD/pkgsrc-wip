Simplify package, update to 1.3.158.

 * Remove INSTALL and add fix-map to rc-scripts instead (start_precmd).
 * Remove dccm option because it was never properly tested.  If someone
   wants it back, let OWNER know.
 * Remove dcc-spamassassin.pre.  DCC.pm will use cdcc in order to obtain
   homedir and therefore the location of the dccifd socket.
 * Add several minor build/install patches.
 * Remove do-install target since the default (DESTDIR-enabled) install
   now works well enough.


CHANGES:

1.3.158
    Do not flood any reports to peers with "leaf=0"
    Fix crash in dccm, dccifd, and dccproc when time jumps backwards by
	more than than 1 millisecond.
    Adjust Makefiles for recent NetBSD.

1.3.155
    Fix `cdcc "help flood"`
    Try `cc -E -w` in ./configure to avoid fatal gcc warning about
	CPPFLAGS=-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 that currently breaks DCC packaging
	on archlinux and will affect other systems.

1.3.154
    Fix editline build problem in cdcc reported by Robert Pelletier.

1.3.153
    Resolve confusion between dccifd ASCII protocol options "no-grey"
	and "grey-off" pointed out by Mark Thomas.

1.3.152
    In `cdcc clients` output, suppress individual client addresses covered
	by an address block in the server /var/dcc/blacklist file except when
	explicitly requested as in `cdcc "clients 10.2.3.0/24"`.

1.3.151
    Compress bad client addresses for `cdcc clients`.

1.3.148
    Answer clients with bad client-IDs and passwords as if they were
	using the anonymous client-ID.
    Improve counting by dccd of clients in address blocks.

1.3.147
    Fix missing clients in `cdcc clients`.
    Fix NetBSD threads problem 1.3.146 reported by Petar Bogdanovic.

1.3.146
    Add -I to `cdcc clients`
    Reduce dccifd thread stack size to 512 KBytes for busy 32-bit systems
    Fix some problems in the Windows version of dccproc.

1.3.145
    Suppress some error messages about broken DCC clients from dccd.
    Fix default start and stop Linux run levels in rcDCC as suggested by
	Herve Eychenne.
    Change start-dccifd to use `kill` instead of `/bin/kill` to accommodate
	Linux systems where /bin/kill does not understand `/bin/kill -9 -$PID`
	as the way to kill a process group.
    `cdcc src` now accepts a pair of IPv4,IPv6 addresses.
    Requests from anonymous DCC clients to the public DCC servers are grouped
	by IPv4 /24 or IPv6 /56 address blocks for inflating the delay.

1.3.144
    Fix a rare crash of dccd, the server daemon.
    Allow "." in -B for dccifd, dccm, and dccproc as the base domain
	name of DNSBL to support detecting and rejecting mail containing
	URLs listed in a response policy zone (RPZ).

1.3.143
    Fix `dccifd -V` broken in 1.3.142 reported by Chris Burton.
    Fix "incompatible whitelist" SMTP bug in dccifd introduced in 1.3.139.
    Deal with default -mstructure-size-boundary=8 in FreeBSD on ARM as
	suggested by Ronald Klop.  However, intermittent failures of
	`cdcc "id 1; stats"` on FreeBSD 9.0-STABLE on a system with a
	"Feroceon 88FR131 rev 1 (Marvell core)" seem to be caused by broken
	consistency between write() and mmap().  That suggests that while
	the DCC client software should generally work, the DCC server will
	occassionally fail mysteriously.
    Fix dccm parsing of Received headers for MX and MXDCC whiteclnt lines
	that broke in verseion 1.3.139.

1.3.142
    Improve physical page locality of the DCC server's use of the database
	hash table and so improve server performance.
    The nagios script in var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios now compares the clock
	on the DCC server with the local clock.
    `cdcc -VV` and other commands produce the ./configure parameters used to
	build them.
    Build cdcc with editline.
    Add -P to dccproc, dccifd, dccm, and dccsight.

1.3.141
    Fix "MTA-last" in dcc man page as suggested by Bram Grietens.
    Fix no_forced-discard typo reported by Bram Grietens.
    Fix dccm to honor `hackmc -R` and discard relay attacks.
    misc/DCC.pm, which is generated from misc/DCC.pm.in, is now very
	similar to what will probably be in SpamAssassin 3.4.
    Fix problems finding native milter library for dccm pointed out by
	Kevin A. McGrail.
    Improve documentation or help output from the nagios plugin,
	/var/dcc/libexec/dcc-nagios
    Fix bug in misc/DCC.pm in dealing with mail that already has an
	X-DCC header found and diagnosed by Herbert J. Skuhra.

1.3.140
    tweak some HTML in the whiteclnt proof-of-concept pages
    Fix bug in `wlist` display of address blocks reported by Rob McMahon.
    Fix missing IP address in log files for mail from (as opposed to
	relayed by) MX relays.

1.3.139
    Give temporary rejections by dccm and dccifd for conflicting per-user
	thresholds a separate message.
    Add FreeBSD "faststart" to rcDCC.

1.3.138
    Fix bad URL decoding reported by Kostik.

1.3.137
    Fix some innocuous compilers warnings on Solaris and Ubuntu.

1.3.136
    Fix dccd and cdcc for `cdcc clients` for large operation counts.
    Deal with trailing '.' and other punctuation URLs in dccm, dccifd, and
	dccproc as pointed out by Kostik.  This changes the FUZ1 and FUZ2
	checksums in some cases.
    Fix a free(0).

1.3.135
    /var/dcc/map on 32 and 64 bit versions of a system are now the same.
    Dccproc, dccm, and dccifd decode HTML &#xxx character references in URLs.
    Dccproc, dccm, and dccifd convert UTF-8 domain names to Punycode
	before checking DNS blacklists.
    Deal with Linux `logger` bug that does the wrong thing with something like
	`logger message with -S dash S` as suggested by Leandro Santi.

1.3.134
    Fix compile bug reported by Rob.McMahon involving old compilers
	without "inline"

1.3.133
    Fix DNSBL bugs in parsing http://example.com?parameter and
	http://example.com:80 reported by Kostik
    Increase number of distinct kinds of local or "substitute" headers that
	can be locally white- or blacklisted to 8

1.3.132
    Fix fstatfs() wrapper on Ubuntu and speed up dccd and dbclean when
	a memory file system is used with -H.

1.3.131
    Fix minor bug in updatedcc and fetch-testmsg-whitelist as suggested by
	Taso N. Devetzis.
    Find in_port_t in sys/types.h as reported by Josh Allen.

1.3.130
    Fix serious bug reported by Bart Dumon in DNS whitelists on systems
	without strlcpy().

1.3.129
    Adjust dnswl.org in the sample dcc_conf file.

1.3.128
    Support DNS whitelists.  An example using dnswl.org is in the sample
	homedir/dcc_conf file.
    Fix dccproc, dccifd, and dccm crash in parsing Received: fields with
	IPv6 addresses.
    Parse IPv6 address literals lacking the "IPv6:" tag in Received: headers.

1.3.127
    Fix problem with `dbclean -H` after a system reboot reported by Gary Mills.
    Fix "duplicate symbol" problem on MacOS X or Darwin 10.3.0
	reported by Robert Pelletier by removing the use of `ranlib -c`.
	I hope this does not break things on older versions of MacOS X
	or future DCC releases.
    Fix printf compiler warnings on MacOS X.

1.3.126
    Fix another problem in flooding server-ID types past server-ID mappings.

1.3.125
    Fix stack corruption in version *.3.124.

1.3.124
    Fix reporting of rogue server-IDs.
    Remove vestiges of obsolete server-ID tracing.
    Flood server-ID types past flod file mappings.
