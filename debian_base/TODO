- these packages are *very* incomplete. testing/improvements/fixes are
  definitely needed.

- firefox for Linux/i386 starts about 50% of the time (and runs
  flawlessly when it does) on NetBSD 2.0E with these libraries, but this
  may be a Linux compat issue. I haven't really tested much else.

- ldconfig handling is non-existant yet.
