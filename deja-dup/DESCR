Deja Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of backing
up the Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses
duplicity as the backend.

 * Support for local, remote, or cloud backup locations such as Google Drive
 * Securely encrypts and compresses your data
 * Incrementally backs up, letting you restore from any particular backup
 * Schedules regular backups
 * Integrates well into your GNOME desktop

Deja Dup focuses on ease of use and personal, accidental data loss.
If you need a full system backup or an archival program, you may
prefer other backup apps.
