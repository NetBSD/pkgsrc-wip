Tries to download file during build:
  Downloading (using Python) https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/releases/download/v140.2.0/librusty_v8_release_x86_64-unknown-netbsd.a.gz

That project only supports Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS according to
https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8/blob/main/build.rs


Later fails again with
  --- stderr
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

    Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
    to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
    to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

    Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.
