depSolver is a Boundary Element Method solver for Laplace's equation in 3D AC
electrostatic problems. I originally wrote this program to study the
characteristics of different dielectrophoretic trap designs. A big advantage of
using this code to calculate dielectrophoretic forces is that the user can
specify which approximation to use for the calculation of the force. In this
manner, without having to change anything in the code, one can use a simple
dipolar or quadrupolar approximation to quickly explore the force generated on a
sphere over a large volume of space, or use the more general calculation based
on the integration of the Maxwell's stress tensor over an arbitrarily shaped
particle.

depSolver is convenient for dielectrophoretic force calculations, but it is in
no way limited to them. It can be used to solve a wide variety of electrostatic
problems as long as they involve conductors were the electric potential is
specified and all dielectrics in the system can be considered as piecewise
homogeneous.
