Detachtty is a Unix system programming utility that lets you run interactive
programs (such as Lisp) non-interactively. Also, it allows you to connect to
them over the network when you do need to interact with them. It's intended for
use with long-running server processes running in Common Lisp implementations

If you've used screen, it's a similar concept, but more suited to traditional
scrolling interfaces whereas screen is better for full-screen (e.g.
curses-based) apps. Compared to screen, detachtty

 - has no capability to swap between different screens (doesn't eat C-a)
 - runs in line-at-a-time mode with no tty emulation (you can sanely use it in
   emacs comint modes or from inside a script(1) session)
 - has no features (less to go wrong)
 - and thus doesn't need a configuration file either
