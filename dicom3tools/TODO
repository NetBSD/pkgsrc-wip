	o test it on NetBSD system, does it build? if not, 
	  see comments in patches/patch-aa
	o imake guru, please have a look at it, I think that some
	  things could be done much better.
	o if you think, that PKGSRC_* variables passed to ./config
	  are strange, have in mind, that I wrote this patch so it
	  could be integrated in mainstream (and not only used by
	  pkgsrc)
