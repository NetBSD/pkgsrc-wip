digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for KDE, which makes
importing and organizing digital photos a "snap". The photos are organized in
albums which can be sorted chronologically, by folder layout or by custom
collections.

You tag your images which can be spread out across multiple folders, and digiKam
provides fast and intuitive ways to browse these tagged images. You can also add
comments to your images.  digiKam makes use of a fast and robust database to
store these meta-informations which makes adding and editing of comments and
tags very reliable.

An easy-to-use interface is provided that enables you to connect to your camera
and preview, download and/or delete your images. Basic auto-transformations can
be deployed on the fly during image downloading.

Another tool, which most artists and photographers will be familiar with, is a
Light Table. This tool assists artists and photographers with reviewing their
work ensuring the highest quality only. A classical light table will show the
artist the place on the images to touch up. Well in digiKam, the light table
function provides the user a similar experience. You can import a photo, drag it
onto the light table, and touch up only the areas that need it.
