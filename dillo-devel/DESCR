Dillo is a web browser designed to be fast, use few resources and
support slow and unreliable networks on resource-constrained machines.
It can load local and remote files via HTTP, HTTPS and FTP.
Other protocols like Gemini, Gopher, IPFS and others are available as
plugins.

Dillo supports a subset of HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1 but it doesn't support
JavaScript and only implements some elements of HTML 5 and CSS 3.
It also renders plain text documents and images in PNG, JPG and GIF
formats.

This package is for FLTK 1.4.
