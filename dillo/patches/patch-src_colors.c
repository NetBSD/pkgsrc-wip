Avoid ctype(3) abuses

Valid argument of ctype(3) functions must be either EOF or non-negative
value within the range representable as unsigned char.  Invalid values
leads to undefined behavior.

Add all missing d*() ctype(3) helper functions and switch to use them.

Noticed by running dillo on NetBSD where dillo crashes due such
abuses.
