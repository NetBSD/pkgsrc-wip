- Note that ${PREFIX}/bin/ding uses a defined path to access it's
  dictionary file.

  If your LOCALBASE variable is not set to /usr/pkg, you'll have to change
  manually the path to ${PREFIX}/share/dict/ger-eng.txt .

- The dictionary file can be frequently updated. You can always fetch a
  newer one at http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/ .

- Have fun!
