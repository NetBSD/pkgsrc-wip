The DISPred project provides tools for calculating deep inelastic scattering
(DIS) cross sections at LO and NLO in QCD. An example program is provided which
will calculate the cross sections for neutral and charged current
electron-proton scattering.

DISpred makes use of QCDNUM (v16) for QCD evolution and the NLO coefficient
functions and uses LHAPDF for the input PDFs.
