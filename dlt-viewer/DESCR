The Diagnostic Log and Trace Viewer is an application that can send and receive
control messages to the DLT daemon, e.g. to set individual log levels of
applications and contexts or get the list of applications and contexts
registered in the DLT daemon. DLT viewer is based on Qt for Windows and Linux
and can run on the Mac though that is not officially supported.
