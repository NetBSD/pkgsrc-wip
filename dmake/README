Package should be working. Reasons why it is not suitable for import to
pkgsrc proper:

- The default rules may still be searched in different location on other
  operating systems/configurations.

- The man page for dmake is incomplete and refers to make(1s).
  Installing this man page (possibly in another section) may create confusion
  with the systems default make.

- There is already a package devel/dmake, containing a different program.
  A different name would be required.
