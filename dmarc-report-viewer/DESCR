A lightweight selfhosted standalone DMARC report viewer that
automatically fetches input data periodically from an IMAP mailbox.
Ideal for smaller selfhosted mailservers to browse, visualize and
analyze the DMARC reports.

The application is a single fully statically linked executable
written in Rust.  It combines a DMARC report parser with an IMAP
client and an HTTP server.  The embedded HTTP server offers a web
UI for easy access and filtering of the reports.
