DMARCaroni appears to be at an early stage of development. There is no
documentation on how to set it up properly. The resulting binary also seems
to require files that are (A) in the source tree but aren't installed, or
(B) not even in the source tree.

The remaining thigs that this package ought to do but currently doesn't
are:
  * To install a default configuration file, and
  * To install a default rc script.
