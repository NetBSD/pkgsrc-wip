doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest
both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime compared
to other feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled
languages such as D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in
the production code thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test
runner with a clean interface.
