This is one of the most popular Doom source ports.
It enhances Doom with things like:
- Free Look
- OpenGL renderer
- Heretic support,
- TCP/IP networking
and much more.

Doom Legacy can play Doom, Boom, Marine's Best Friend (MBF), and Heretic maps.
In addition to the original games by id Software and Raven Software, there are
hundreds of free, fan-made maps available on the Internet. These maps are
typically distributed as PWAD files, which are not fully self-contained.
For each game you will also need the corresponding IWAD data file, which
contains all the graphics, wall and floor textures, sounds, and music for that
game. For example, if you want to play Doom II maps, you'll need the IWAD file
doom2.wad, or one of the free replacements.

Legacy has implemented the fundamental and de-facto-standard Boom extensions,
and the Marine's Best Friend (MBF) extensions. Legacy also has implemented
among other things 3D floors, swimmable water and other special effects using
extended linedef codes, and supports the FraggleScript scripting language.

This package contains the SDL1 build of Doom Legacy.
