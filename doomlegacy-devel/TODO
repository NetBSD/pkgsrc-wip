[X] Some middle-textures are rendered wrong in Pagodia
    => Reported upstream in ticket #687

Part 25: Add UMAPINFO support
=============================
[X] Based on libdoom-umapinfo-1.0.0
    => Module to parse and import data added
[X] Hook keys into game engine
    => All keys should work now, up to the limits of the engine
[X] Add support for "\n" line breaks in key "intertext".
[X] Use Doom zone memory as libdoom-umapinfo memory manager

=> Created upstream feature request ticket #100


Part 26: Incorrect voodoo doll behaviour
========================================
[X] Player stuck in Solar Struggle (map E3M6)

    (is not pushed away e.g. from an explosion as expected).
    => Reported upstream in ticket #688
    No fix required. Vanilla behaviour can be configured via menu.


Part 27: Some bossactions are not Vanilla-compatible
====================================================
[X] Player stuck in Atonement (map 01)
    => Reported upstream in ticket #690
