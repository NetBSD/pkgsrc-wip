This package acts most of all as a meta-pkg to grep all dependecies, which are a bit work to figure out.

At the moment nothing is done with to dotproject tarball.

There are also some recomended patches to the php, apache and mysql config-files.
The mysql-server can of corse run on another machine then the apache-php combo.

There is a lot left todo. As this is far far away from an auto installation.
