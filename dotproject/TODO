This package acts most of all as a meta-pkg to grep all dependecies, which are a bit work to figure out.

At the moment nothing is done with to dotproject tarball.

There are also some recomended patches to the php, apache and mysql config-files.
The mysql-server can of corse run on another machine then the apache-php combo.

There is a lot left todo. As this is far far away from an auto installation.

- This package has known vulnerabilities, please investigate and fix if possible. (see: http://packetstorm.linuxsecurity.com/0808-exploits/dotproject-sqlxss.txt).
