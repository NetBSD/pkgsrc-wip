Prepare COMMIT_MSG.

Reduce diffs to mail/dovecot to ease review:
  $NetBSD$ lines
  Check and maybe reduce all other diffs
    
    I checked all other diffs, and most of them seem to be applied already.
    Except for several additions of #include <sys/time.h>, but that doesn't
    seem to break the build, so I'll assume those patches are no longer needed.

--with-ssl seems to be an non-existing option for configure.
It looks like dovecot-2.4.2/m4/ssl.m4 says ssl is not optional, and it has to
be OpenSSL.

--with-libwrap seems to be an non-existing option for configure.

    I wonder if adding libwrap support back is easy?

Add comments to both patches, and upstream URL or argument that the
patch does not belong upstream.

Explain (COMMIT_MSG) why wiki is going away.

Address having to define _NETBSD_SOURCE.  This is very likely an
upstream bug that some XOPEN visibility define is set, and that turns
everything else off.  Consider if avoiding defining that is adequate,
and/or patching, and filing upstream.

Address the strategy of a lot of config files.  Does dovecot really
need all those files?  Installed config should be minimal and the user
is welcome to steal from examples.

    Currently it doesn't install a whole conf.d directory of config file
    fragements any more. This difference is actually annoying when upgrading
    from the previous version, which did do that.
