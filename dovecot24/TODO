I get lots of compiler warnings (with gcc12) about re#defining memcpy() such as

  CC       welcome-plugin.lo
In file included from welcome-plugin.c:3:
../../../src/lib/lib.h:79: warning: "memcpy" redefined
   79 | #  define memcpy(dest, src, n) i_memcpy(dest, src, n)
      |
In file included from /usr/include/string.h:127,
                 from ../../../src/lib/lib.h:22:
/usr/include/ssp/string.h:95: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   95 | #define memcpy(dst, src, len) __ssp_bos_check3(memcpy, dst, src, len)
      |


The original #define seems to come from the stack smashing protection. Maybe we do not want to override this with whatever i_memcpy() is?
Or if we do, it should be cleaner, such as with an #undef memcpy beforehand.
