dpkg - Debian's package maintenance system

This is the dpkg suite of programs that form the foundation of the Debian's
package management system; on the lower layer there are 'dpkg-deb' and
'dpkg-split' programs handling the binary formats, and 'dpkg-source' program
handling the source formats; there is a collection of tools to handle building
source packages into binary packages; there is the medium-level and less
user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) in the form of the 'dpkg' command;
and then there is the terminal user interface (TUI) 'dselect' program (which
has gone out of preference in favor of the apt (CLI) and aptitude (TUI)
programs).

The dpkg suite also includes some other programs currently maintained
on external repositories, namely 'dpkg-repack', 'dpkg-www', 'dupload'
and 'debsig-verify'.
