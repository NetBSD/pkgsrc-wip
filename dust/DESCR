du + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive.

Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using
disk space without requiring sort or head.
It will print a maximum of one 'Did not have permissions message'.

Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest
subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the
larger ones.
There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag.
The largest subdirectories will be colored.

Apparent-size is calculated slightly differently in dust to gdu.
In dust each hard link is counted as using file_length space. In gdu only the
first entry is counted.
