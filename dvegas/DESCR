Dvegas facilitates adaptive Monte Carlo integration based on an enhanced and
extended version of Peter Lepage's VEGAS algorithm. It allows to automatically
take into account correlations between sets of dimensions and to fully adapt the
sampling of sums of integrals. The code is genuinely object-oriented and written
in ISO/ANSI standard C++. Parallel computation is supported through
an interface to omniORB, a high-performance, open-source CORBA implementation
from AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. Notably, it does not require thread-safe
integrand implementations.
