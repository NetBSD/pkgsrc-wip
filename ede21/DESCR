EDE (Equinox Desktop Environment) is a simple and fast desktop
environment with familiar look and feel.  EDE uses the FLTK toolkit
for GUI presentation and the UNIX philosophy for it's design, where
EDE splits each component in a separate executable entity to do
one job, and do it good.  This makes EDE very easy to alter for
user needs and requirements.
