-# There are problems with paths and conflicts between shared libraries.
-# In particular, the modified GCC requires that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
-# path be set to point to it first to make usage easy. However the edoc
-# binary post processing tool is built with the platforms native GCC.
-# This means that when we use the modified GCC, we need to have extra
-# path options, and when we run the edoc application we need to have
-# normal path options.
-#
-# This script is responsible for setting up the environment such that
-# we can achieve this.
-#
-# What we will do for now is to save the old environment into 
-# EDOC_OLD... and setup to use a new environment in a new shell.
-# 
-# We will make sure that the edoc and edc-arch applications are later 
-# in the path than the edoc_patched/bin directory and we will create
-# two scripts: edoc_patched/bin/edoc and edoc_patched/bin/edc-arch
-# These two scripts will restore the environment to what it was before
-# calling this script and then invoke the real edoc or edc-arch binaries
