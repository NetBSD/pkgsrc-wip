Efgallery is a static photo gallery generator in Perl with a simple
look and feel: it shows your photos, and optionally detects faces
so they aren't cropped in the thumbnails.

Efgallery stands for "extended fgallery" as it was inspired from
the fgallery 1.x version.

You can see an example galleries at the following addresses:

https://marabu.ch/efgallery/demo/ (efgallery)
https://alexschroeder.ch/gallery/ (sitelen-mute)
http://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/software/fgallery/demo/ (fgallery 1.x)

There is no server-side processing, only static generation. The
resulting gallery can be uploaded anywhere without any additional
requirements on the web server or browser.
