EiC is a freely available C language interpreter in both
source and binary form. EiC allows you to write C programs,
and then "execute" them as if they were a script (like a Perl
script or a shell script). You can even embed EiC in your
own programs, allowing your application to have a "scripting"
language that is syntactically equivalent to C. It is also
possible to let an EiC "script" call compiled library code and
for compiled code to make callbacks to EiC user defined functions.
