ELinks is an advanced and well-established text-mode web (HTTP/FTP/..) browser
with a wide range of additional features and extensibility by the possibility
to plug in own scripts in Lua language. This project aims to provide
feature-rich version of Links, with more open patches/features inclusion
policy. This OpenSource project is covered by the GNU General Public License.

This is version current-0.13-stable. An update to the 0.12pre6 version
available in pkgsrc/www. Created due to SSL Errors that occur with some sites
and stop them from loading altogether under 0.12pre6. It is fixed with 0.13.
Patches are as per the pkgsrc/www version, only line numbers, etc were
updated so they applied cleanly. Some patches were no longer required because
the changes had been incorporated into 0.13.
