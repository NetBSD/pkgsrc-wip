When you start Emacs, package Session restores various variables
(e.g., input histories) from your last session. It also provides a
menu containing recently changed/visited files and restores the places
(e.g., point) of such a file when you revisit it.

As opposed to desktop.el and other packages, Session does not
automatically revisits all files from your last session, most of which
are not interesting anymore.
