The Emerald Theme Manager allows you to install, edit and switch between Emerald
themes. In order for it to work, select Emerald as your window decorator. You
will also need to enable the Window Decorations plugin (via CCSM).

As a window decorator, Emerald controls the appearance of your window borders;
please see your desktop environment's own theme settings if you wish to change
the appearance of things inside windows, such as buttons, menus and scrollbars.

This package contains themes for Emerald.
