Enigma is a re-implementation of one of the most original and intriguing
computer games of the 1990's: Oxyd.
Your objective is easily explained: find and uncover all pairs of identical
Oxyd stones in each landscape. It would be simple, if it weren't for hidden
traps, vast mazes, insurmountable obstacles and innumerable puzzles blocking
your direct way to the Oxyd stones.
