Evisum - System Monitor.

This is a process and system monitor for Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and
DragonFlyBSD. It is server-client based and includes rudimentary tools for
process, CPU, memory, network, storage and sensor querying. The current set of
features aims to reach a common denominator between the three popular and
viable Unix-like operating systems at this time: Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
