Unlike BIRD or Quagga, ExaBGP was not designed to transform a general purpose
server into a router, but to allow engineers to control their BGP (rfc4271)
network easily. Think of it as Software Defined Networking for people with
"commodity" routers.

ExaBGP transform BGP (rfc4271) messages into friendly plain text or JSON
which can be easily manipulate by scripts.

It allows the creation of tools such as:
 * advanced looking glass graphically display the routing of prefix
 * high availability tool which automatically isolate broken services
 * DDOS mitigation
 * an anycasted server
