Exomizer is a program that compresses files in a way that tries to be as
efficient as possible but still allows them to be decompressed in environments
where CPU speed and RAM are limited. For some popular 8-bit computers using
6502 compatible CPUs it can also generate executable files that decompress
themselves in memory when run.
