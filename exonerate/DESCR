Exonerate is a generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison. It
allows you to align sequences using a many alignment models, either
exhaustive dynamic programming or a variety of heuristics.

It uses the C4 dynamic programming library. It is designed to be both
general and fast. It can produce either gapped or ungapped alignments,
according to a variety of different alignment models. The C4 library
allows sequence alignment using a reduced space full dynamic
programming implementation, but also allows automated generation of
heuristics from the alignment models, using bounded sparse dynamic
programming, so that these alignments may also be rapidly
generated. Alignments generated using these heuristics will represent
a valid path through the alignment model, yet (unlike the exhaustive
alignments), the results are not guaranteed to be optimal.
