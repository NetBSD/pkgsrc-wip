Facedetect is a simple face detector for batch processing. It
answers the basic question: "Is there a face in this image?" and
gives back either an exit code or the coordinates of each detected
face in the standard output.

The aim is to provide a basic command-line interface consistent
and easy to use with software such as ImageMagick.

Facedetect is currently used in pkgsrc efgallery to improve the
thumbnail cutting region so faces are always centered.
