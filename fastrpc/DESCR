FastRPC is a RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol based on the XML-RPC which
uses binary format for data serialization. It uses HTTP as transport protocol
as the XML-RPC does. FastRPC is also an implementation of this protocol as C++
library and Python and PHP4 modules built with this library.

The library supports both protocols due to FastRPC's full data compatibility
with the XML-RPC. Data format is negotiated via the HTTP content negotiation.

The fastrpc Python module is compatible with the xmlrpclib module. It's very
simple to port project from xmlrpclib to fastrpc.
