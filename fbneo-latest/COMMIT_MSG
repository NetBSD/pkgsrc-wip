emulators/fbneo-latest: Add fbneo-latest version 1.0.0.03

Packaged in wip by adr.

This is an update of emulators/fbneo. I contacted mainstream
asking for a new release so joysticks can be configured:

"Nightlies are the recommended builds, and the only ones we provide
support for. Anybody using an outdated version of FBNeo is strongly
advised to update to the latest nightly.  Arguably, i've been
considering bumping the version more regularily, but that would be
for the sake of having easier versioning for romset management,
not for the sake of having outdated versions available from 3rd
party package managers."

The project uses now an included version of libspng (https://libspng.org).
Input is now configurable by the tab menu.
Fixed bugs, new emulation features, &c.
