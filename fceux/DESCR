FCEUX is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, and Famicom Disk System
(FDS) emulator. It supports both PAL (European) and NTSC (USA/JPN) modes. It
supports both Windows and SDL versions for cross compatibility.

The FCEUX concept is that of an "all in one" emulator that offers accurate
emulation and the best options for both casual play and a variety of more
advanced emulator functions. For pro users, FCEUX offers tools for debugging,
ROM-hacking, map making, Tool-assisted movies, and Lua scripting.

FCEUX is an evolution of the original FCE Ultra emulator. Over time, FCE Ultra
had separated into many distinct branches.

The concept behind FCEUX is to merge elements from FCEU Ultra, FCEU rerecording,
FCEUXD, FCEUXDSP, FCEUXDSP CE, and FCEU-mm into a single branch of FCEU.
