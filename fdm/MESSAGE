It's suggested to run fdm as non privileged user, else
create an ad-hoc user as in the following example:

   # useradd -d /nonexistent -s /sbin/nologin -g=uid -u 30 _fdm

You can start a new configuration file by writing only
few lines (no filtering):

   set maximum-size 128M
   action "maildrop" pipe "/usr
   account ....
   match all action "maildrop"

Also you may want to run it every half hour or so. To
do it just add the following line to the crontab(5):

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l fetch
