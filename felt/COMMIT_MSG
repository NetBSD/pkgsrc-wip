(3.06 to 3.07 Changes are not found yet)

** Changes to FElt from 3.05 to 3.06 (released 3/24/00)

The following bugs/things were fixed/changed:
   1. the details stream was getting set all the time on the regular
      writing of structural results, producing extraneous output
      if the details flag hadn't actually been set
   2. the text output for static thermal analysis was going to 
      stdout rather than the output window in velvet
   3. as part of the rearrangement of the isoparametric elements and
      element stresses/nodally averaged stresses, the components of the
      stress vectors for cst, iso_2d, iso_quad, and axisymm elements
      have changed.  All of them (plus bricks) now have 10 components:
      sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, tau_xy, tau_xz, tau_yz, sigma_1, sigma_2,
      sigma_3, and the von Mises stress.  (sigma_r, sigma_z, sigma_theta,
      tau_rz, 0, 0, sigma_1. sigma_2, 0, sigma_VM for axisymm elements).
   
The following features were added:
   1. all of velvet's post-processing graphics except animation and mode 
      shapes have been ported over to OpenGL.  The big reason for this is to
      provide 3D color plots of stress and displacement for problems
      using brick elements, but it also makes the post-processing code
      quite a bit cleaner and provides nice rotation control.  Try
      loading the new examples brick_cap.flt and brick_ring.flt into
      velvet (ignore the no nodes in the z=0 plane message), solve,
      and plot stresses or displacements.  As mentioned above, all of
      the plottable stresses are now nodally averaged results.  The
      component can vary from 1 to 10.  Displacements are treated the
      same as before.   Saves don't really work yet.  If you need a
      dump you can always xwd the window on your own and crop it and
      convert it as necessary.
