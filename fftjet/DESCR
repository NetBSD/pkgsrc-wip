The purpose of the FFTJet package is reconstruction of particle jets in
High Energy Physics collider data. FFTJet considers the energy flow in the event
at multiple angular  resolution scales, locates jet-like
structures using powerful Fourier-domain filtering techniques, and establishes
hierarchical relationships  between clusters found at different scales. With
FFTJet, you will be able to:

 * Cleanly separate the tasks of defining "what is a jet", locating jets,
    selecting the event topology, and reconstructing jet energies
 * Utilize global, efficient, collinear and infrared safe jet algorithms
 * Optimally cluster jets in the presence of magnetic field
 * Take into account and suppress the detector noise
 * Understand, analyze, and visualize jet substructure
 * Apply unusual energy flow analysis techniques: fuzzy clustering and
    multiscale blob detection
 * Run parts of your jet reconstruction code on GPUs
 * And much more...

The FFTJet system is designed to be highly extensible, so that you can easily
explore your own ideas about pattern recognition and jet energy reconstruction
in HEP events.
