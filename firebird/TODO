Does it compile on NetBSD-stable?

Does it compile on NetBSD-current?

DISTFILE issue. Please read Makefile.

FreeBSD build breaks at:
	../gen/firebird/bin/create_db empty.fdb
	operating system directive semget failed
	-No space left on device
	gmake[3]: *** [empty.fdb] B³±d 254
... and this has nothing to do with disk space. I am unable to debug it, as
my gdb seems to have problems with gcc-3.3-compiled binaries. Possibly a job
for someone with NetBSD-current or FreeBSD 5.x box

Create PLIST, when it finally builds.

Firebird can be compiled as "classic" and "super" version -- I have no idea
how do they differ; I think, when it is ready, Makefile should be divided to
Makefile and Makefile.common and package should be split to "firebird" and
"firebird-super"

Because of the comments I put in Makefile, pkglint screams out loud.
Remember about silencing it when the comments are not needed.
