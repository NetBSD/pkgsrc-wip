These comments were for the 1.5 version of the package:

Firebird can be compiled as "classic" and "super" version -- I have
no idea how do they differ; I think, when it is ready, Makefile
should be divided in Makefile and Makefile.common and package should
be split in "firebird" and "firebird-super".

		The classic is forking and superserver is threaded.

Update package in order to fix multiple vulnerabilities. Reference:

CVE-2016-1569
CVE-2017-6369
CVE-2017-11509

	"The vulnerabilities are fixed in version 2.1 RC1."
		It's still 2.0, but maybe I will do an early update.
