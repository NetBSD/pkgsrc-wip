FIREHOSE gives you that power. FIREHOSE gives you a basic data transfer over
multiple network devices supporting TCP/IP layers. Stripe multiple 100Mbit,
Gigabit, 10 Gigabit, or firewire to give one humungous pipe for firehosing
your gigabytes and gigabytes of data.

Unlike RAID striping, FIREHOSE striping load balances the network devices so
every ounce of bandwidth is utilized. Combine a 400Mbit firewire eth device
with a 100Mbit eth device to get 500Mbits of power. Combine 10 100Mbit
ethernet ports for a gigabit pipe. The number of devices which can be
striped is limited only by imagination and budget.
