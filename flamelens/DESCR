flamelens is an interactive flamegraph viewer in the terminal.

Flamegraph tools such as FlameGraph, https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
and inferno, https://github.com/jonhoo/inferno process output from various
profiling tools and generate intermediate data in the folded format ready for
flamegraph plotting.

Instead of plotting the flamegraph as an SVG file, flamelens takes the folded
stacks data and generate an interactive flamegraph in the terminal.

No more hauling SVG files and opening a browser just to have a quick look at the
profiling result!
