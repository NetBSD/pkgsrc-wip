Flexbackup is a flexible backup tool.

Features:
   o Easy to configure
   o Uses dump, afio, GNU tar, cpio, star, pax, or zip archivers
   o Full and numbered levels of incremental backup (acts like "dump")
   o Compression and buffering options for all backup types
   o Does remote filesystems (over rsh/ssh; no special service)
   o Package delta mode can backup files not owned by rpm,
     or owned+changed files.
   o Writes to tapes, on-disk archive files, or on-disk directory trees
   o Keeps a table of contents so you know what archives are on each tape
   o Nice log files

Software needed:
   o perl
   o fileutils, findutils (a "find" capable of using the -regex switch)
   o one or more of
       dump/restore, afio, GNU tar, star, pax, cpio, zip
   o mt (if using tapes)
   o gzip, bzip2, lzop, or compress (optional)
   o buffer (optional) [needs patches or recompile for 2+GB file support]
