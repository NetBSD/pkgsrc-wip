flimp is a generic graphical frontend to the many excellent command line
image manipulation tools available.  It allows you to create pipelines
of commands that read from standard input and write to standard output.
One can view and compare the result of each stage of the pipeline.
flimp leaves the input image file untouched; the pipeline is saved in
a text file.
flimp features non-destructive image manipulation, 16bit color depth,
import of raw images via dcraw, and is easy to extend and customize.
