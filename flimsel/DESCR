flimsel is a minimalistic digitial image browser based on the fltk toolkit. It
displays thumbnails of images given on the command line. It is intended to be
used in digital image processing shell scripts see script in the examples
directory. flimsel uses the very fast epeg library by The Rasterman (Carsten
Haitzler) for JPEG thumbnail generation but falls back to fltk native methods
for other image formats.
