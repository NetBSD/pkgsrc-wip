flnews is a client with graphical user interface to read USENET newsgroups.
It is intended for POSIX compliant operating systems running the X window
system.

The main development goals are (in order of importance):
- No bloat
- Support for old workstations
- Standard compliance
- Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
- Compatibility with other newsreaders
- Usable X display redirection via network (or ssh tunnel)
- Warn users about things that are not forbidden but considered "bad practice"

Features that are currently not implemented (or not usable yet):
- UUCP
- Multiple servers
- Offline mode (for network connection via dialup line)
