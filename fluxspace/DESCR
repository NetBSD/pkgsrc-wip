What Is It?

Fluxspace blends Fluxbox's window management with new desktop management
capabilities. It leverages existing components and the power of Python to help
build a flexible desktop environment around Fluxbox and other lightweight
window managers.

What Can It Do Now?

    * Add per-workspace desktop icons and panels to Fluxbox by integrating
	  tools like Rox Filer and Idesk.
    * Decorate each workspace with different wallpaper.
    * Manage your startup applications.
    * Automatically start and stop applets as you enter and leave workspaces,
	  allowing each workspace to have its own unique tools and dockapps.
