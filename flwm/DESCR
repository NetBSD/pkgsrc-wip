Flwm is an attempt to combine the best ideas seen in several window managers.
The primary influence and code base is from wm2 by Chris Cannam.

Primary features are:

     * Nifty sideways titlebars.
     * No icons. You deiconize by picking off a pop-up menu. This means no
       space is wasted by icons.
     * The same pop-up menu controls multiple desktops and lets you launch
       programs.
     * Occupies as little screen space as possible. The border and titles are
       as thin as I could possibly make them. And maximized windows waste
       zero pixels vertically!
     * Independent maximize buttons for width & height.
     * Understands Motif, KDE, and Gnome window manager hints, and works with
       SGI programs that assumme 4DWM.
     * Really small and fast code.
