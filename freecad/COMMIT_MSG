FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for CAD,
MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product
design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, such as architecture
or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open Source (LGPL2+ license) and
extremely modular, allowing for very advanced extension and customization.

FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an Open
Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the Coin 3D
library, and a broad Python API. The interface is built with Qt.

FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and Linux platforms.
