F R E E D U P - allows you to reclaim space on your drive. It's simple.
===============================================================================
Freedup walks through the file trees (directories) you specify.
When it finds two identical files on the same device, it hard links them
together.
In this case two or more files still exist in their respective directories,
but only one copy of the data is stored on disk; both directory entries point
to the same data blocks.
[FREEDUP IN ACTION]
If both files reside on different devices, then they are symlinked together.
Please see the Syntax_page for instructions, how to modify the behaviour of
freedup.
