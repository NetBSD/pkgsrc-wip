FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite element
method. It enables you to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDE) easily.

Problems involving PDE (2d, 3d) from several branches of physics such as
fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data on several meshes
and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem++ includes a fast
2^d-tree-based interpolation algorithm and a language for the manipulation
of data on multiple meshes (as a follow up of bamg)
