FreeJ is a vision mixer: an instrument for realtime video manipulation used
in the fields of dance teather, veejaying, medical visualisation and TV.

With FreeJ multiple layers can be filtered thru effect chains and then mixed
together. The supported layer inputs are images, movies, live cameras,
particle generators, text scrollers, flash animations and more.

All the resulting video mix can be shown on multiple and remote screens,
encoded into a movie and streamed live to the internet.

FreeJ can be controlled locally or remotely, also from multiple places at the
same time, using its slick console interface; can be automated via javascript
and operated via MIDI and Joystick.
