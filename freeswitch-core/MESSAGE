* There are many modules that are not enabled by default. If they are required,
  please  manually enable them in ${WRKSRC}/modules.conf file. As for now, 
  some required by wip/fusionpbx (GUI interface) were included.
  (You should deinstall, enable the modules, update your PLIST or
  use CHECK-FILES=no and then install again)

* The local_ip_v4 variable is used by sofia-sip module. However, automatic
  detection of this value might fail after install. The workaround is
  to manually set the local_ip_v4 value in vars.xml, usually located at:
	${PREFIX}/etc/freeswitch/vars.xml.
  Example:  
	<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="local_ip_v4=[yo.ur.i.p]"/>

* The event_socket_module by default has an IPv6 configuration, therefore,
  it is unable to load properly. Please set your IP address or '0.0.0.0' in
  the event_socket.conf.xml file inside conf_dir/autoload-configs/ directory.

* If you are willing to spend some time installing a GUI interface, you might
  want to check wip/fusionpbx. Highly recommended.
