* There are many modules that are not enabled by default. If they are
  required, please  manually enable them in ${WRKSRC}/modules.conf file.
  As for now, some commonly used were included.

  (You should deinstall, enable the modules, update your PLIST or use
  CHECK-FILES=no and then install FreeSWITCH again, if new modules
  were enabled.)

* The 'local_ip_v4' variable is used by sofia-sip module.
  However, automatic detection of this value might fail. The workaround
  is to manually set the local_ip_v4 value in vars.xml, usually located at:
	${PREFIX}/etc/freeswitch/vars.xml.

  Example:
	<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="local_ip_v4=yo.ur.i.p"/>
	Replace "yo.ur.i.p" with a proper value.

* The event_socket_module by default has an IPv6 configuration, therefore,
  it is unable to load properly. Please set your binding IP address in
  the event_socket.conf.xml file inside conf_dir/autoload-configs/

* FreeSWITCH doesn't come with a GUI. If you have the time, take a look to:
	wip/fusionpbx package.
