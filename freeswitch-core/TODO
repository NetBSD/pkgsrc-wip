* Drop MESSAGE, and instead put files in share/doc/PKGNAME/.

* There are some bundled libs that are currently imported to pkgsrc & pkgsrc-wip.
  Nevertheless, these bundled libs are patched by upstream developers.
  I ran into many errors while integrating pkgsrc libs instead of the bundled ones.
  Thus, further work needs to be done to make them work or bundled libs are
  unavoidable.    Specific issues are:

    - wip/libzrtp (does not build on netbsd-7 amd64)

* Use of CONF_FILES framework to avoid pkglint errors. 

* This package has only been tested on FreeBSD 11.  It does not build
  on NetBSD 7 amd64.

* Determine a strategy for modules.  Arguably, the modules built by
  the core package should be the default from upstream.  Ideally, it
  would be possible to build modules separately so they can be in
  their own package.
	UPDATE: Modules were included in the options.mk framework.
	This will replace previous patch-modules.conf used (which was not ideal).
	Since modules are bundled it is not possible to build them separately.
	Not all modules were included. Work in progress.
