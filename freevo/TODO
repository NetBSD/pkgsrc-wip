Check the fantastic PLIST twice. You can even sort it.

Doesn't work yet -- pkgsrc Python issues, at least on my box. Marc has did a
great job with Python package, but some more has to be done.

E-mail:
	http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=46652	
and ask for NetBSD (pkgsrc) package placement at:
	http://freevo.sourceforge.net/install.html
_when_ it works. No earlier.
