ftpsesame helps the FTP protocol get through your pf(4) firewall. It does
this by passively analysing FTP control connections and adding rules into a
pf(4) anchor when an FTP data connection is about to commence.

You might want to try ftpsesame instead of ftp-proxy(8) for the
following reasons:

* it runs on "transparent" (no IP address) bridges
* you need packetfilter performance on all data connections
* you have to handle lots of simultaneous sessions
* you do not want to redirect any traffic to the firewall itself:
  for IP accounting or other reasons

In general, ftpsesame is a good choice to run on a firewall in front of
multiple FTP servers, where no NAT is involved. ftp-proxy(8) is usually the
best choice when users behind NAT need to access FTP servers on the Internet.
In other situations it depends, sometimes they are useful together.
