Multiple problems on NetBSD:
* does not parse options correctly:
  "-b 128", "--bitrate=128" not recognized
  "-h", "-V" cause core dumps
  First chunk of patch-src_mp3fs.c fixes this for some people
* does not handle two path arguments like usage suggests
  mp3fs /a /b
  errors out; secund chunk of patch-src_mp3fs.c works around this,
  but that's not a solution and I don't know how it's supposed to
  work
