Squashfuse lets you mount SquashFS archives in user-space. It supports almost
all features of the SquashFS format, yet is still fast and memory-efficient. So
that everyone can use it, squashfuse supports many different operating systems
and is available under a permissing license.

SquashFS is an efficiently compressed, read-only storage format. Support for it
has been built into the Linux kernel since 2009. It is very common on Live CDs
and embedded Linux distributions.
