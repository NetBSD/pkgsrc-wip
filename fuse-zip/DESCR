fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create and
modify ZIP archives based in libzip implemented in C++.

With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real
directories.  Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any
application without modifications.

Unlike other FUSE filesystems, _only_ fuse-zip provides write
support to ZIP archives. Also, fuse-zip is faster that all known
implementations on large archives with many files.
