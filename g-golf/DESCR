G-Golf is a tool to develop fast and feature-rich graphical
applications, with a clean and recognizable look and feel. Here is an
overview of the GNOME platform libraries, accessible using G-Golf.

In particular, libadwaita provides a number of widgets that change
their layout based on the available space. This can be used to make
applications adapt their UI between desktop and mobile devices. The
GNOME Web (best known through its code name, Epiphany, is a good
example of such pan adaptive UI.

G-Golf uses Glib, GObject and GObject Introspection. As it imports a
Typelib (a GObject introspectable library), G-Golf defines GObject
classes as GOOPS (the Guile Object Oriented System) classes. GObject
methods are defined and added to their corresponding generic
function. Simple functions are defined as scheme procedures.
