A simple library written in the C++ language for performing arithmetic over
Galois fields.The arithmetic can be in the form of either elements or
polynomials over a specified Galois field.The library is optimised to run in one
of two modes, normal or LUT mode. In the LUT mode performance is increased
dramatically at the cost of large consumption of memory. The library can be used
in but not limited to such fields as cryptography, error correcting codes and
computational analysis.
