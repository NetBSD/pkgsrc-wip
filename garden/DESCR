Garden streamlines development workflows that involve a loosely-coupled set
of multiple, independent Git trees.

Garden allows you to define dynamic relationships and workflows between these
repositories using a declarative YAML config file that can be shared and used
as a bootstrapping mechanism for getting a auditable, from-source project
cloned, built, installed and running with minimal effort for consumers
of a Garden file.

Garden sits above any individual project's build scripts and conventions.
Garden is all about making it easy to remix and reuse libraries maintained in
seperate Git repositories.
