gcalcli is a Python application that allows you to access your Google
Calendar(s) from a command line. It's easy to get your agenda, search for
events, add new events, delete events, edit events, and even import those
annoying ICS/vCal invites from Microsoft Exchange and/or other sources.
Additionally, gcalcli can be used as a reminder service and execute any
application you want when an event is coming up.
