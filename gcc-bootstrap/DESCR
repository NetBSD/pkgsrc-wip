GCC bootstrap builder (includes GNAT).

Provides minimal set of GCC compilers (C, C++, Ada) that can bootstrap
GNAT. It is not intended to be included in the main tree but to
provide a reproducible build. This project replaces bootstrap
compilers for pkgsrc's GNAT <= 6 which can not build newer GNAT >= 13.
