Busted on NetBSD-current (5.99.01 at the time of writing).
Lots of problems because of missing ssize_t and conflicts to standard header
files for memcpy etc.

--Add support for what's commented out in the Makefile.
--I think the C++ ABI stuff is OK, but that needs to be checked.
--I use -current and only need what this package already supports (C/C++/objc)
so others will have to hack on it to get the rest going, as I don't have time
[right now].
--Anything else I missed?
--Of course, to import this, the relevant rules will have to be added
to gcc.mk.

--Anything else?
