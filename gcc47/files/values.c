# This is Solaris x86 specific GCC run-time environment patch, which
# makes it possible to reliably deploy .init snippets. Trouble is that
# Solaris linker erroneously pads .init segment with zeros [instead of
# nops], which is bound to SEGV early upon program start-up. This bug
# was recognized by GCC team [it is mentioned in source code], but
# workaround apparently and obviously erroneously slipped away in some
# newer GCC release. This patch compensates for this mishap by dropping
# modified values-X*.o into GCC installation tree. Object modules in
# question are normally provided by Sun and linked prior crtbegin.o.
# Modified versions are additionally crafted with custom .init segment,
# which does some magic:-)
