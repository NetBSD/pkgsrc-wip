1) Add latest fix from lamg/gcc48/patches/patches-patch-gcc_ginclude_stddef.h.

2) Fix cilkplus errors in the teststuite. Snapshot 20140323 was fine and
then massive changes were introduced upstream for the 4.9.0 release. Now
all cilkplus execution tests fail like this:

spawn /usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/build/gcc/xgcc -B/usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/build/gcc/ /usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/gcc-4.9-20140416/gcc/testsuite/c-c++-common/cilk-plus/PS/reduction-1.c -B/usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/build/x86_64--netbsd/./libcilkrts/ -L/usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/build/x86_64--netbsd/./libcilkrts/.libs -fno-diagnostics-show-caret -fdiagnostics-color=never -ftree-vectorize -fcilkplus -std=c99 -O3 -fcilkplus -lm -o ./reduction-1.exe
/usr/bin/ld: ./reduction-1.exe: hidden symbol `__cpu_model' in /usr/pkgsrc/wip/gcc49snapshot/work/build/gcc/libgcc.a(cpuinfo.o) is referenced by DSO
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
compiler exited with status 1

3) lang/gcc48 has been changed to a meta package. Mabey this should be used
for a new start on lang/gcc410.
