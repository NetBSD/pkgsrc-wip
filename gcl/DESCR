GCL is the official Common Lisp for the GNU project. Its design makes use of
the system's C compiler to compile to native object code, providing for both
good performance and facile portability. GCL currently compiles itself and
the primary free software Lisp applications, Maxima and ACL2, on eleven
GNU/Linux architectures (x86 powerpc s390 sparc arm alpha ia64 hppa m68k
mips mipsel), Windows, Sparc Solaris, and FreeBSD. On most platforms, GCL
can load native object code modules directly into its lisp core, where they
are preserved in any custom lisp images produced via the save-system call.
