  raster read-only drivers (required libhdf5)
* Add raster [GTI](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gti.html) (GDAL Raster Tile
  Index) driver to support catalogs with huge number of sources.

# GDAL/OGR 3.8.0 Releases Notes

GDAL/OGR 3.8.0 is a feature release.
Those notes include changes since GDAL 3.8.0, but not already included in a
GDAL 3.7.x bugfix release.

## In a nutshell...

* Add [JSONFG](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/jsonfg.html) read/write vector
  driver for OGC Features and Geometries JSON.
* Add [PMTiles](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pmtiles.html) read/write vector
  driver for PMTiles v3 datasets containing MVT PBF tiles
* Add [S102](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/s102.html) raster read-only driver
  for S-102 bathymetric products (depends on libhdf5)
* Add [gdal_footprint](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_footprint.html) utility:
  compute the footprint of a raster file, taking into account nodata/mask band,
  and generating polygons/multipolygons corresponding to areas where pixels are
  valid (#6264)
* Python bindings: various enhancements to reduce the number of "gotchas"
  related to inter-object ownership relationships, and a few syntaxic sugar
  enhancements
* Arrow interface: improve spatial and attribute filtering on read side;
  add write side with OGRLayer::WriteArrowBatch()
* GeoPackage: much faster spatial index creation (~ 3-4 times faster)
* ARG driver deprecated: will be removed in 3.9.0
