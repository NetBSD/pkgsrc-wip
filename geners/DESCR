The geners package is designed to address the problem of C++ object persistence
in situations where the most typical data access pattern is write once read man
(WORM). This access pattern is very common in scientific projects ? a data
recording device or a simulation program creates the original set of objects
which is later reused (typically, for the purposes of data analysis and
presentation of results) by other programs. Geners is, more or less, a set of
tools and conventions which allows its users to develop C++ classes that can be
converted to and from a storable stream of bytes in a well-organized and
type-safe manner. Serialization of STL containers is supported, including the
ones added in the C++11 standard. Independent versioning of each class
definition is allowed. Geners code depends only on the standard C++ facilities
and on two well-established portable data compression libraries, zlib and
bzip2
