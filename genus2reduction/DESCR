genus2reduction is a program for computing the conductor and reduction types
for a genus 2 hyperelliptic curve.

As an example of genus2reduction's functionality, let C be a proper smooth curve
of genus 2 defined by a hyperelliptic equation y^2+Q(x)y=P(x), where P(x)
and Q(x) are polynomials with rational coefficients such that deg(Q(x))<4,
deg(P(x))<7. Let J(C) be the Jacobian of C, let X be the minimal regular model
of C over the ring of integers Z.

This program determines the reduction of C at any prime number p
(that is the special fiber X_p of X over p), and the exponent f of
the conductor of J(C) at p
