Gfan is a software package for computing Groebner fans and tropical varieties.
These are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial ideals. The maximal cones of
a Groebner fan are in bijection with the marked reduced Groebner bases of its
defining ideal. The software computes all marked reduced Groebner bases of an
ideal. Their union is a universal Groebner basis. The tropical variety of a
polynomial ideal is a certain subcomplex of the Groebner fan. Gfan contains
algorithms for computing this complex for general ideals and specialized
algorithms for tropical curves, tropical hypersurfaces and tropical varieties of
prime ideals. In addition to the above core functions the package contains many
tools which are useful in the study of Groebner bases, initial ideals and
tropical geometry. Among these are an interactive traversal program for Groebner
fans and programs for graphical renderings.

For ordinary Groebner basis computations Gfan is not competitive in speed
compared to programs such as CoCoA, Singular and Macaulay2.
