The goal is to have an easy way of exploring your fonts.
You point the program to a directory containing font files
and it scans it and presents them in a list. At start-up,
it will scan some predefined directories for fonts, and, if
present, will list them in a combo box, which behaves
similarly to the input line of web browsers, including a
history of visited directories.
