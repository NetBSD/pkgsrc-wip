The goal is to have an easy way of exploring your fonts. 
You point the program to a directory containing font files 
and it scans it and presents them in a list. At start-up, 
it will scan some predefined directories for fonts, and, if 
present, will list them in a combo box, which behaves 
similarly to the input line of web browsers, including a 
history of visited directories.
