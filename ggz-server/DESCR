GGZ Gaming Zone

GGZ is a project to create a free gaming platform.  The project includes
a server, games for the server, clients, and games for the clients.  Other
projects may include ggz networking into their games.  GNOME games project
and Freeciv 2.1 releases use ggz.

This package contains the server and game programs that run with the server.

Note:  Currently, the server will run on NetBSD, but the games won't work.
