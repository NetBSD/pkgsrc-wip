GHDL is a shorthand for G Hardware Design Language (currently, G has no
meaning). It is a VHDL analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental)
synthesizer that can process (nearly) any VHDL design.  Unlike some other
simulators, GHDL is a compiler: it directly translates a VHDL file to machine
code, without using an intermediary language such as C or C++. Therefore, the
compiled code should be faster and the analysis time should be shorter than
with a compiler using an intermediary language.

This package is created to build dev version of ghdl for those interested in
newer features and bug fixes that are newer than the last released version.
