$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.8 2012/12/20 07:37:28 makoto Exp $
- Report to upstream the patches

- Check X11_TYPE=native/modular and 6.0_RC2 and 5.1.2
           5.1.2  6.0_RC2  Darwin 10.6.
   native    o      o      o
   modular          o

- In some case, probably because x11-links behavior,
  Following line is needed in /etc/mk.conf
  DEPENDS_TARGET=         package-install

- Update configure.ac patch

- Add comments on patch-a{h,l}
  patch-ah seems to be needed on native xorg build.
 (See cvs log 1.3 of print/ghostscript/patches/patch-ah)
  At least modular xorg builds fine without patch-ah.

- Build on DragonFly BSD is not tested
  for the patch-openjpeg_libopenjpeg_opj_malloc_h

-----------------------------------------
- To fix a problem with one particular combination:

(1) the option at 
wip/ghostscrip-cidfonts-ryumin
set
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa

(2) and only if gs invoked from dvipdfmx via following sequence:
    ps2pdf
    ps2pdf14
    ps2pdfwr
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

gs failed to find the font Ryumin-Light-EUC-H
----

Meaning that 
(a) if
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= adobe-cidfonts
set -> OK

(b) 
gs alone invoked command line, the same file 
(included in *.eps used above (2) problem)
can be processed successfully even if
following line in /etc/mk.conf mentioned in (1)
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa
is set.
-----------------------------------------
Above problem is turned out to be related -dSAFER
option included in ps2pdfwr script. The similar thing
was reported as following PR.
Bug 691780 - -dSAFER seems to prevent loading of a ttf font 
  http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691780
-----------------------------------------
Interim fix is to eliminate -dSAFER from ps2pdfwr script.
