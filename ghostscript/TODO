- Review patches/patch-af carefully for Darwin
  (Actually Mac OS X has problem making libgs.9.05.dynlib)

- Build on DragonFly BSD is not tested
  for the patch-openjpeg_libopenjpeg_opj_malloc_h

- pdftoraster seems gone compared to 9.0.4, (with cups only)
  -${PLIST.cups}libexec/cups/filter/pdftoraster
  -${PLIST.cups}share/examples/cups/pdftoraster.convs
  But is it intentional or not: unknown yet (to me, mef@)
  Having tried to add pdf with FEATURE_DEV as
    patches/patch-base_unix-gcc.mak
  But no luck yet.

- To fix a problem with one particular combination:

(1) the option at 
wip/ghostscrip-cidfonts-ryumin
set
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa

(2) and only if gs invoked from dvipdfmx via following sequence:
    ps2pdf
    ps2pdf14
    ps2pdfwrt
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

gs failed to find the font Ryumin-Light-EUC-H
----

Meaning that 
(a) if
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= adobe-cidfonts
set -> OK

(b) 
gs alone invoked command line, the same file 
(included in *.eps used above (2) problem)
can be processed successfully even if
following line in /etc/mk.conf mentioned in (1)
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa
is set.
