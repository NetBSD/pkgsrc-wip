Please do NOT touch this patch. It allows gimp-current to be built
on gcc earlier than 3.x  . If you don't know, what it does, why is it
really needed, go and read a bit about differences between standards
supported by gcc 3.x and gcc 2.x, but first - do NOT touch it until it's 
not needed (this has been fixed in gimp-cvs).
