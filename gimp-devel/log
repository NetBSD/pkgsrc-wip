pkgsrc: enable JXL support

Overview of Changes from GIMP 3.0.0-RC2 to GIMP 3.0.0-RC3
=========================================================

Core:

  - Filters:
    * Apply noninteractive filters direct to drawable.
    * Gamma hack removed.
    * Filter names are not stored in XCF anymore unless it was
      explicitly set.
    * Major image graph update so that we don't cast back to storage
      pixel format in-between filters making non-destructive filters a
      lot more powerful. We now only cast during preview of filters when
      "Merge filter" checkbox is checked.
    * More image graph update: we only crop before the first effect on a
      filter stack for a given drawable. Further pre-crops are now no-op
      nodes.
  - More robust program loading even on systems with no fonts at all.
  - Various missing help-ids added.
  - The debugging infrastructure was not getting backtraces for all
    threads (only the main thread) since 2.99.10 because of a hanging
    bug in gdb. This is now reverted as a test.
  - Reworking of projection flushing to make it thread-safe (e.g. when
    projection updates are requested from the "paint" thread).
  - Improved support for cloud providers' file loading.
  - Dashboard: performance log filenames now contain the timestamp in
    ISO-8601 basic format.

Graphical User Interface:

  - Show icons in Tips Dialog on Windows.
  - Add Help buttons to About/Tips/Welcome dialogs.
  - macOS: open files from Finder on macOS 15 (Sonoma) and higher with
    new implementation.
  - Various theming tweaks improving usability.
  - Don't show Release Notes in Welcome dialog when none exist.
  - Various icons now have RTL variants (by inverting the opposite
    icons, e.g. go-next/go-previous).
  - Various usability improvements.

Plug-ins:

  - DDS:
    * Various improvements to BGR8 and other formats.
    * New support for importing DDS BC7 compression.
  - BMP: various import improvements and code cleanup.
  - EXR: more robust EXR file import, especially regarding invalid files
    (e.g. fuzzed ones).
  - Script-Fu:
    * new named argument syntax for non-core (i.e. plug-in
      created) PDB procedures allowing arguments to be set in any order
      and more semantically.
    * The new named argument syntax can also be used for arguments of
      filters (though string still works as there is no confusion
      possible with another syntax).
    * SF-FILENAME and SF-DIRNAME args now create a GimpParamSpecFile
      argument with the proper action type.
    * Script-Fu third-party scripts using the standalone interpreter can
      now be localized properly with the same default logic as other
      plug-ins.
  - PSD:
    * Metadata export now supported.
    * 16-bit per channel LAB PSD are now supported at import.
    * PSD compatibility messages are now selectable for easy copy-paste.
    * Store proper merged image when exporting CMYK PSD files.
  - All plug-ins with a GFile argument now use a GimpParamSpecFile spec.
  - JPEG-XL: export options were simplified:
    * CMYK is always saved as lossless: lossy CMYK is discouraged by
      libjxl developers and results in visible artifacts.
    * "Save original profile" option is removed. We now simply follow
      the profile settings of the image.
  - ICNS:
    * ipc4, ipc5, and ipc6 type ICNS icons do not render well when
      included in an app as part of a bundle. We now use older is32,
      il32, and ih32 24-bit RGB formats (with 8 bit masks) instead of
      the newer PNG formats for those sized icons.
    * Support loading ARGB ICNS icons.
    * Support loading pre-OSX ICNS with no masks.

API:

  - Changes in libgimpbase:
    * Creation time metadata are added (for various tags in IPTC, XMP
      and Exif) when first creating a new image.
    * New functions:
      + gimp_metadata_set_creation_date() allowing to set a custom creation date.
      + gimp_param_spec_file_get_action()
      + gimp_param_spec_file_set_action()
      + gimp_param_spec_file_none_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_unit_percent_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_unit_pixel_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_core_object_array_get_object_type()
      + gimp_param_spec_value_array_get_element_spec()
      + gimp_param_spec_choice_get_choice()
      + gimp_param_spec_choice_get_default()
    * New GimpFileChooserAction enum type.
    * New GimpParamSpecFile param spec type.
  - Changes in libgimp:
    * New functions:
      + gimp_procedure_is_core()
      + gimp_param_spec_resource_defaults_to_context()
      + gimp_param_spec_resource_none_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_display_none_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_drawable_filter_none_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_image_none_allowed()
      + gimp_param_spec_item_none_allowed()
    * gimp_pdb_query() doesn't return private PDB procedures anymore.
    * The various "save-*" PDB procedure arguments for export plug-ins
      were renamed to "include-*" and made public.
    * gimp_file_save_thumbnail() renamed gimp_file_create_thumbnail()
      and now supporting when the file is the export or import image.
    * GFile arguments are now stored as URI rather than path in config
      files.
    * gimp_procedure_dialog_get_widget() now supports GimpParamSpecUnit
      arguments.
    * Filters based off GIMP-made GEGL operations with a custom
      configuration object are now configurable through the PDB/libgimp,
      like any other filters.
    * Filters created by libgimp are always set as "unclipped".
      Functions to control this settings will likely happen after 3.0.0
      release.
    * Compat PDB-only procedure plug-in-autocrop is now transformed to
      proper gimp-image-autocrop procedure with corresponding libgimp
      function gimp_image_autocrop().
    * Compat PDB-only procedure plug-in-autocrop-layer is now
      transformed to proper gimp-image-autocrop-selected-layers
      procedure with corresponding libgimp function
      gimp_image_autocrop_selected_layers().
    * Both the new autocrop procedures now allow a NULL input drawable
      and will use the image for determining cropping extents in this
      case.
  - Changes in libgimpwidgets:
    * New GimpFileChooser widget.
    * New functions:
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_action()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_file()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_label()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_label_widget()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_title()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_get_type()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_new()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_set_action()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_set_file()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_set_label()
      +  gimp_file_chooser_set_title()
      +  gimp_prop_file_chooser_new()
  - Changes in libgimpui:
    * GimpProcedureDialog now create automatically a GimpFileChooser
      with UI adapted to the requested action for the argument (through
      gimp_procedure_dialog_get_widget()), such as opening/creating a
      file/folder.
    * Removed functions:
      + gimp_procedure_dialog_get_file_chooser()

Translations:

  - New Swedish language support for the Windows installer.

Build:

  - Massive cleanup of useless dependencies and adding back some missing
    runtime dependencies in CI and packages.
  - In-build GIMP process is now run through gdb (when available) to
    help debug crashes of GIMP during the build.
  - API docs now use the development logo.
  - New CMYK PAM tests (for test-file-plug-ins testing infrastructure).
  - Improve shared Docker Debian versioning in the CI and make it branch
    aware.
  - Crossbuild jobs are back in CI and with UCRT.
  - Meson option -Dg-ir-doc was removed.
  - No build attempt to use build caching in CI. It was just making
    problems with no clear gain.
  - AppImage packages (x86_64 and AArch64) are now official packages.
  - MS Store version is now automatically uploaded through the CI.
  - Minimum dependency requirement update: GEGL 0.4.54.
