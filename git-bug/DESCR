git-bug is a bug tracker that:

- is fully embedded in git: you only need your git repository to have a
  bug tracker
- is distributed: use your normal git remote to collaborate, push and
  pull your bugs!
- works offline: in a plane or under the sea? Keep reading and writing
  bugs!
- prevents vendor lock-in: your usual service is down or went bad? You
  already have a full backup.
- is fast: listing bugs or opening them is a matter of milliseconds
- doesn't pollute your project: no files are added in your project
- integrates with your tooling: use the UI you like (CLI, terminal,
  web) or integrate with your existing tools through the CLI or the
  GraphQL API
- bridges to other bug trackers: use bridges to import and export to
  other trackers
