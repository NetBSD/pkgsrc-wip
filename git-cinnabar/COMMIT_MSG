devel/git-cinnabar, devel/py-hg-cinnabarclone: update to 0.7.0beta2

While here: Disable `version-check' feature so git-cinnabar doesn't
phone home every time you run it.

Upstream release notes:

0.7.0-beta.2 Pre-release

What's new since 0.7.0-beta.1?

 * Based on git 2.46.2.
 * Avoid showing an update notification for the current beta version when it is the latest release.
 * Fixed git push --dry-run to not report spurious errors.
 * Allow git push --dry-run to create metadata for the changesets the push would create.
 * Various changes to download.py and git cinnabar self-update.


0.7.0-beta.1 Pre-release

/!\ As of version 0.7, some corner cases in Mercurial repositories will generate different git commits than with prior versions of git-cinnabar. This means a fresh clone might have different git SHA-1s than existing clones, but this doesn't impact the use of existing clones with newer versions of git-cinnabar.

Most repositories should remain non-affected by the change.

You can set the cinnabar.compat git configuration to 0.6 to keep the previous behavior.

What's new since 0.6.3?

 * Based on git 2.46.0.
 * Fixed git cinnabar fsck to avoid misreporting weird old Mercurial file history as metadata corruption.
 * Fixed the creation of empty trees for manifests.
 * Fixed access to ssh remotes with absolute paths.
 * Fixed cinnabarclone extension with Mercurial >= 6.6.
 * Fixed handling cinnabar.refs=heads,tips (backwards incompatible change).
 * Various optimizations making clones and pulls faster.
 * Made negotiation with repo with large number of heads faster for pull and push.
 * git cinnabar fetch and git cinnabar reclone now handle everything internally instead of delegating to git fetch and git remote, respectively.
 * git cinnabar reclone doesn't lose metadata history when a cinnabarclone is used.
 * A clone with cinnabarclone now only records one metadata update instead of two when there are updates after the cinnabarclone.
 * git cinnabar reclone now only records one metadata update even when pulling from several remotes at the same time.
 * git cinnabar reclone will try to restore as many of the heads it knew about, fetching from skipDefaultUpdate remotes if necessary.
 * git cinnabar reclone --rebase allows to automatically rebase local branches and detached heads when git commits change after the reclone (e.g. when switching between a plain clone to a grafted clone, or when there was a bug in the original conversion)
 * cinnabar.check=no-bundle2 now pretends the Mercurial server doesn't support bundle2.
 * Updated crate dependencies.
 * Many refactors, including the conversion of many functions from C to Rust.
 * Experimental support for tweaking the similarity level when detecting copies and renames during a push.
 * Experimental support for pushing named branches and tags.
