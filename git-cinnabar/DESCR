git-cinnabar is a git remote helper to interact with mercurial
repositories. Contrary to other such helpers, it doesn't use a
local mercurial clone under the hood.

The main focus at the moment is to make it work with mozilla-central
and related mercurial repositories and support Mozilla workflows
(try server, etc.).
