git-who is a command-line tool for answering that eternal question:

> Who wrote this code?!

Unlike `git blame`, which can tell you who wrote a _line_ of code, `git-who`
tells you the people responsible for entire components or subsystems in a
codebase. You can think of `git-who` sort of like `git blame` but for file
trees rather than individual files.
