GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same
time. It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches
while still having them applied to your working directory. You can then push
branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of git add -p and git rebase -i,
allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.
