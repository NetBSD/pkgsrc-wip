GitLab is Open source software to collaborate on code.

It manages Git repositories with fine grained access controls that keep your
code secure. It can perform code reviews and enhance collaboration with merge
requests.

It has support for complete continuous integration (CI) and continuous
deployment/delivery (CD) pipelines to build, test, and deploy applications.
Each project can also have an issue tracker, issue board, and a wiki.

Used by more than 100,000 organizations, GitLab is the most popular solution to
manage Git repositories on-premises. It is completely free and open source (MIT
Expat license).

This package contains only the assets for GitLab.
