Givaro main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many
mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite Fields, Finite
Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary precision integers and
rationals (C++  wrappers over gmp). It also provides data-structures and
templated classes for the manipulation of basic algebraic objects,
such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse, structured), univariate polynomials
(and therefore recursive multivariate). It contains different program modules
and is fully compatible with the LinBox linear algebra library and the KAAPI
kernel for  Adaptative, Asynchronous Parallel and Interactive programming
