gjots2 is a fairly simple jotter application for your desktop.

It displays your data organised in a tree with each leaf being your text.
Getting data into gjots2 is fairly easy - you can type it in, directly import
kjots files, cut and paste text or use an editor to convert other text files
to the simple gjots2 format (see below for details). You can also convert an
existing DOCBOOK file into gjots2 format with docbook2gjots(1).

gjots2 files can be simply converted into HTML using gjots2html(1) or into
DOCBOOK with gjots2docbook(1) Sensitive data can be encrypted by ccrypt(1),
openssl(1) or gpg(1) simply by saving with an appropriate file suffix and
providing a password.
