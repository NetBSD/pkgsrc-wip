- How to handle installation correctly? Currently everything is installed
  into /usr/pkg and after ldconfig is run other applications might not
  run anymore. The solution is to delete the installed files after which
  everything is okay again.

- Set USE_PKGLOCALEDIR and adapt PLIST.

- Security issues: SA41795, SA42547, SA43976, SA43492, CVE-2015-8982,
  CVE-2015-8983, CVE-2015-8984, CVE-2015-8985 (and probably others)
