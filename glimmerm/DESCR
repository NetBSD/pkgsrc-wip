A gene finder derived from Glimmer, but developed specifically for 
eukaryotes. It is based on a dynamic programing algorithm that 
considers all combinations of possible exons for inclusion in a gene 
model and chooses the best of these combinations. It uses Interpolated 
Markov Model(IMM) for selecting the best gene model. The system has 
been trained for Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), and 
Plasmodium falciparum (the malaria parasite), and should work well on 
closely related organisms.
