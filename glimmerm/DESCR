A gene finder derived from Glimmer, but developed specifically for
eukaryotes. It is based on a dynamic programing algorithm that
considers all combinations of possible exons for inclusion in a gene
model and chooses the best of these combinations. It uses Interpolated
Markov Model(IMM) for selecting the best gene model. The system has
been trained for Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), and
Plasmodium falciparum (the malaria parasite), and should work well on
closely related organisms.
