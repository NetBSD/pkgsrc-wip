Glulxe (for "Glulx Execute") is the Glulx interpreter.

Glulx is a portable VM, like the Z-machine.  Unlike the Z-machine,
it uses 32-bit data and addresses, so it can handle game files up
to four gigabytes long.  Also unlike the Z-machine, it has native
support for Glk I/O, so game files can use any capability Glk
provides.  However, like the Z-machine -- again -- you can write
games in the Inform language and compile them to Glulx game files.
