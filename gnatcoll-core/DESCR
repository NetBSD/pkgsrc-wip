The GNAT Components Collection (GNATcoll) - Core packages

The reusable library known as the GNAT Component Collection (GNATColl) is
based on one main principle: general-purpose packages that are part of
the GNAT technology should also be available to GNAT user application code.
The GNATColl components complement the predefined Ada and GNAT libraries
and deal with a range of common programming issues including string and text
processing, memory management, and file handling.
