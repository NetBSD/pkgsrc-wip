Gnocchi calculates complexity on a per function basis. Instead of
trying to parse C++ code Gnocchi reads the coverage information
produced by GCC. If code is compiled with -fprofile-arcs or
-ftest-coverage (depending on compiler version) GCC creates a .gcno
file for every object file. Please refer to you GCC manual for
details.
 
Gnocchi calculates cyclomatic and the NPATH complexity measures.
