Gnocchi calculates complexity on a per function basis. Instead of trying to
parse C++ code Gnocchi reads the coverage information produced by GCC. If code
is compiled with -fprofile-arcs or -ftest-coverage (depending on compiler
version) GCC creates a .gcno file for every object file. Please refer to you GCC
manual for details.

Gnocchi calculates cyclomatic and the NPATH complexity measures.
