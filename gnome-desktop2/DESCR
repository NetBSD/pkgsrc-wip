This package contains the libgnome-desktop library which contains
APIs that really belong in libgnome[ui] but have not seen enough
testing or development to be considered stable.
Use at your own risk.

Also contained here are documents installed as part of the core
GNOME distribution, e.g. the GPL, GNOME's .desktop files, the
gnome-about program, some manpages and GNOME's core graphics
files and icons.
