gnormalize is a front end to normalize, an audio converter, a ripper, an
encoder, a cd player and a metadata (tag) editor. It uses gtk2-perl under
GNU/Linux.

gnormalize decodes the MP3/MP4/MPC/OGG/APE/FLAC file to WAV, then normalizes
the WAV to a targeted volume level and re-encodes it. gnormalize can also rip,
encode, convert audio format between MP3, MP4, MPC, OGG, APE and FLAC, change
the encoding and matadata (tag) properties of final normalized files.
