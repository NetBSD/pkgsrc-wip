  - XXX: gnunetuser currently prevents a shutdown via "normal" shutdown(1),
    it does however work when you shutdown via your X11 manager etc.
    This is due to this service not shutting down:
      /usr/pkg/lib//gnunet/libexec/gnunet-rest-server -c /home/nikita/.config/gnunet.conf
- build on linux and freebsd
  - currently broken on Linux due to bluez-libs being too old and not building.
