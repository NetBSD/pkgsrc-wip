## [3.10.10.0] - 2024-04-06

### Changed

#### Runtime

- Modernize location of config files. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` will be used if set
(often `$HOME/.config`). This change attempts to be backward compatible with
existing config file locations, but be aware that config files may show up
in the old (`$HOME/.gnuradio/`) and new (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnuradio`)
locations depending on GNU Radio version. Files are not automatically moved,
since some users run multiple versions of GNU Radio.
- Ctrlport Probe, Ctrlport Probe PSD and gr-ctrlport-monitor. Ctrlport Monitor blocks
are still broken.

#### GRC

- NEW Qt-based front end! Run `gnuradio-companion --qt` to try it out. This feature is
still in testing, so the Gtk front end runs by default. In a future release, Qt will
become the default, removing Gtk as a manditory dependency. Maintenance will focus on
the Qt front end at that point.
- Restore property field background colors (as a View option, off by default) for the Gtk
front end. Background colors were previously replaced with textual type string.
- The canvas can be panned using the middle mouse button
- C++ code generation improvements related to parameters and strings
- C++ code generation fixed for Add Const

#### gr-audio

- Added 96 kHz and 192 kHz selections to ALSA source/sink

#### gr-blocks

- Float To UChar block adds vector support, and also scale and bias params

#### gr-digital

- Additive Scrambler adds soft symbol handling

#### modtool

- Improvements to handling of Python blocks (add, rm, and rename work reliably)
- New parseable manifest format (yaml instead of md) to better support the OOT ecosystem
- Manifest and examples are installed by "make install"

#### Build system and packaging

- Python byte-compiled (pyc) files are no longer installed, as they are
deprecated by Python

#### Testing

- Added MinGW test runner and fixed various MinGW compilation failures
- Update Fedora to test 38, 39 and 40
