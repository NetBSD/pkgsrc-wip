This package converts any file into managable Go source code. Useful for
embedding binary data into a go program. The file data is optionally gzip
compressed before being converted to a raw byte slice.

It comes with a command line tool in the go-bindata sub directory. This tool
offers a set of command line options, used to customize the output being
generated.
