go-cache is an in-memory key:value store/cache
similar to memcached that is suitable for
applications running on a single machine. Its
major advantage is that, being essentially a
thread-safe map[string]interface{} with expiration
times, it doesn't need to serialize or transmit
its contents over the network.
