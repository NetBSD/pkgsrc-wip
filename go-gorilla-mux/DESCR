and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to
their respective handler. The name mux stands for
"HTTP request multiplexer. Like the standard
http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests
against a list of registered routes and calls a handler
for the route that matches the URL or other conditions.
