- Instead of removing `keyring' support, properly patch it to support more
  Unix-like platforms (while for `keyring' it's probably trivial that would also
  need UnixCreds support that ATM seems implemented only for Linux... For NetBSD
  that's probably doable but I have no idea about other Unix-like platforms.)
  Given that... probably importable in the pkgsrc tree also without doing this
  TODO item.
