The DGEE is implemented as a Goldwater application.
Goldwater is a highly scalable distributed middleware
that promotes the building of applications as a collection
of separate but logically connected processes. Goldwater
does all the work of routing messages between these
processes as though they were mere function calls, even
if they are distributed across several servers, and
performs queuing and timeouts as necessary. The DGEE
therefore inherites Goldwaters scalability and resilience
along with its management and maintenance features.
