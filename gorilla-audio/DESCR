Gorilla Audio is a library that can be used for playing real-time
audio.  (It's possible that it can be used for other things too,
but we don't know anything about that.)

It was originally written by Tim Ambrogi, engine programmer at
Final Form Games, and as such has a slight bias towards game
development, but should still be very suitable for other real-time
audio playing needs.
