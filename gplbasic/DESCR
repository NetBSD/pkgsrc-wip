GPL'ed Basic interpreter for Unix-like systems.
Includes benchmarks and unit tests.

Why yet another BASIC interpreter? There are no free BASIC
interpreters for Unix that offer a capability that is even remotely
comparable to that of QBASIC. Bwbasic is kind of broken (ever tried to
use FOR or NEXT statements in multistatement lines?), it lacks graphic
commands and is is slowwwwwwww as molasses.  Two orders of magnitude
increase in speed over bwbasic looks interesting.....
