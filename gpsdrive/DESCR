GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive
displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS receiver on a
zoomable map, the map file is autoselected depending of the position and
prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival" software
is running. The maps are autoselected for best resolution depending of
your position and can be downloaded from Internet. All Garmin GPS
reveiver with a serial output should be usable, also other GPS receiver
which supports NMEA protocol. GpsDrive is written in C with use of the
GTK+ graphic toolkit.
