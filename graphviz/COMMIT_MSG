graphics/graphviz: Update to 9.0.0

## 9.0.0 - 2023-09-11

### Added

- On non-Windows platforms, new -Tkitty and -Tkittyz output formats are
  available that render to the Kitty terminal emulator’s graphvics
  protocol.
- HTML/CSS-style 3 letter hex colors are supported. Each R/G/B letter
  is duplicated to form a 6 letter hex color. E.g. #09c is equivalent
  to #0099cc. #2377

### Changed

- Breaking: The definition of adjmatrix_t is no longer exposed in public
  headers.
- Breaking: The upper limit for minimum edge length
  (Agedgeinfo_t.minlen) has been expanded from USHRT_MAX to INT_MAX.
  #2413
- Breaking: The libcdt macros DTTREEMATCH, DTTREESEARCH, dtvnext,
  dtvcount, dtvhere, and dtcharhash have been removed.
- Breaking: The libcgraph macros AGHEADPOINTER, AGRIGHTPOINTER,
  AGLEFTPOINTER, FIRSTNREF, NEXTNREF, PREVNREF, LASTNREF, NODEOF,
  FIRSTOUTREF, LASTOUTREF, FIRSTINREF, NEXTEREF, and PREVEREF have been
  removed.
- Breaking: The libcgraph types Agnoderef_t and Agedgeref_t have been
  removed.
- Breaking: The libcgraph function agflatten has been removed.
- Breaking: The Agdesc_s.flatlock field has been removed.
- Breaking: The str parameter from gvPluginList has been removed.
- Breaking: The definition of the elist_append and alloc_elist macros
  have been changed to use newer allocation functions. Users were/are
  not expected to call these macros.
- The functions ageqedge, agtail, aghead, agopp, agmkout, and agmkin
  have been reintroduced. These were previously removed in Graphviz
  3.0.0. #2433
- Breaking: The first parameter dt to the makef and freef callbacks
  defined in cdt.h has been removed.
- Gvedit now identifies itself with organization name “Graphviz” and
  application name “gvedit” when reading and writing Qt-based settings.
  It would previously use organization name “Trolltech” and application
  name “MDI Example”. If you have existing settings under the old
  identification, Gvedit will attempt to migrate them to the new
  identification the first time it reads then writes settings. #2383
- Breaking: gvprintf is now tagged with
  __attribute__((format(printf, …))) when compiling with Clang or GCC.
  This enables the compiler to spot more misuses of this function. #2373
- Breaking: The hashf and eventf members of Dtdisc_t have been removed.
  Correspondingly, the hshf and evf parameters to the DTDISC macro have
  been removed. Also the _DTHSH macro has been removed.
- Breaking: The Dtdata_t.minp field has been removed.
- The print functionality of the macOS Graphviz app scales the graph to
  fit the output page size.
- Breaking: The libcdt containers Dtbag, Dthash, Dtlist, Dtorder,
  Dtdeque, and Dtstack have been removed.
- Breaking: The libcdt dtappend and dtattach macros have been removed.
- Support for Lua 5.0 has been removed. Building the Graphviz Lua
  bindings now requires Lua ≥ 5.1.
- Breaking: The Dt_t* parameter to the callback for dtwalk has been
  removed.
- Breaking: The POINTS_PER_PC macro has been removed.
- Breaking: The INITIAL_XDOT_CAPACITY macro has been removed.
- Breaking: The type parameter to dtdisc has been removed.
- Breaking: The h parameter to dtstrhash has been removed.
- In addition to Guile 2.0 and Guile 2.2, Guile 3.0 is now supported by
  the Graphviz Guile bindings.
- Breaking: The concept of “memory allocator discipline” has been
  removed, along with the type Agmemdisc_t and fields Agdisc_t.mem and
  Agdstate_t.mem.
- Breaking: The agcallbacks function and Agclos_t.callbacks_enabled have
  been removed.
- Breaking: pack_info.doSplines is now a C99 bool. Correspondingly, the
  doSplines parameter to shiftGraphs is now a C99 bool.

### Fixed

- Processing large graphs that induce ranks containing more than 46340
  (floor(√INT_MAX)) nodes no longer results in an integer overflow
  during crossing matrix allocation. Ranks of up to floor(√SIZE_MAX)
  nodes are now supported.
- Double arrow head types like invdot and onormalonormal once again
  display correctly. This was a regression in Graphviz 8.0.1. #2406
- The lvee and rvee edge arrow shapes are slighty incorrect for
  penwidths > 1. #2399
- Small gap between lcurve or rcurve arrow shaft and node. #2426
- Failure of arrowhead and arrowtail to respect penwidth #372
- Fixed also for the normal and inv edge arrow shapes when using the l
  or r arrow shape modifiers.
- Slightly improved for the normal and inv edge arrow shapes when not
  using any arrow shape modifier.
- Fixed also for the crow and vee edge arrow shapes and record based
  nodes.
- Various incorrect calls to gvprintf have been corrected. On some
  platforms like x86-64, these problems were benign thanks to
  coincidences in the Application Binary Interface (ABI).
  On other platforms, these problems may have caused stack corruption
  and crashes. #2373
- The font dictionary is now initialized even if a configuration file is
  not found. Previously this situation could lead to a crash when using
  Graphviz programmatically. This problem was present as least as far
  back as Graphviz 2.38.0. #1520
- Breaking: The vt100 output format has been renamed to vt. This fixes
  a problem where it was not discoverable on macOS. #2429
- Escape sequences like \" are recognized in strings and double
  escaping (producing \\") is avoided. #2397
- The Autotools build system no longer uses headers and libraries from
  the --prefix path given on the command line. This previously caused
  cross-compilation to incorrectly pick up host headers and libraries.
  #2442
