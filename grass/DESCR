Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as
GRASS GIS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) used for
data management, image processing, graphics production,
spatial modelling, and visualization of many types of data.
GRASS contains over 350 programs and tools to render maps and images
on monitor and paper; manipulate raster, vector, and sites data;
process multi spectral image data; and create, manage, and store
spatial data. GRASS uses both an intuitive windows interface as well
as command line syntax for ease of operations. GRASS is ideal for use
in engineering and land planning applications.
