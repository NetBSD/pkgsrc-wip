Being overflooded with different logfile colo(u)?ri(s|z)ers,
colortails, gccolors, colormakes and similar programs for making
text files or outputs of different programs more readable by
inserting ansi colour control codes into them, I decided to write
my very own colouriser, eventually providing the functions of all
those others.

Two programs are provided: grc and grcat.  The main is grcat, which
acts as a filter, i.e. taking standard input, colourising it and
writing to standard output.
