Gromit-MPX is an on-screen annotation tool that works with any Unix
desktop environment under X11 as well as Wayland.

Its main use is for making presentations of some application.
Normally, you would have to move the mouse pointer around the point of
interest until hopefully everybody noticed it.  With Gromit-MPX, you
can draw everywhere onto the screen, highlighting some button or area.

The name stands for (GRaphics Over MIscellaneous Things -
Multi-Pointer-EXtension). It is a multi-pointer port of the original
Gromit annotation tool by Simon Budig.
