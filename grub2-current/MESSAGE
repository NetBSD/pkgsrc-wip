To actually install GRUB 2 to disk, use grub-install(8).  But do
not use it unless you understand what it actually does, for it may
lead to loss of data when used improperly.

Please visit the official web page of GRUB 2, for more information.
The URL is <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/>.

More extensive documentation is available in the Info manual,
accessible using 'info grub'.

There are a number of important user-visible differences from the
first version of GRUB, now known as GRUB Legacy.  For a summary,
please see:
