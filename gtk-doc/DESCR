The GTK+ Reference Documentation Project (RDP) aims to provide a
complete set of reference material for the GLib, GDK, and GTK+
libraries.

It is created using the gtk-doc system, which parses C header files
and creates 'template' files which are then filled in by the authors.
These template files are then converted into DocBook SGML, and from
there to HTML or printed output.
