- this package could be split to parts dependent only on gtk2-engine they
  use - for example, all GTK2-Smooth-* use gtk2-engines-smooth

- could we use a DIST_SUBDIR?
  
- new engines should be added ("industrial", "galaxy") to fully support all
  themes

- add buildlinks for engines (?)

patches for LighthouseBlue engine added. We could get a newer engine
version, so those patches won't be needed anymore.
