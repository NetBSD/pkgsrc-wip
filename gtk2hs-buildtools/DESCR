This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build the
Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include a modified c2hs binding
tool that is used to generate FFI declarations, a tool to build a type
hierarchy that mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects found in glib,
and a generator for signal declarations that are used to call back
from C to Haskell. These tools are not needed to actually run Gtk2Hs
programs.
