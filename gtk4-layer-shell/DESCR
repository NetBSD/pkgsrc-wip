A library for using the Layer Shell and Session Lock Wayland
protocols with GTK4. This Library is compatible with C, C++
and any language that supports GObject introspection files
(Python, Vala, etc). The Layer Shell protocol allows building
desktop shell components such as panels, notifications and
wallpapers. It can be used to anchor your windows to a corner
or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output.
The Session Lock protocol allows building lock screens.
