GtkHash is a desktop utility for computing message digests or checksums.
Most well-known hash functions are supported, including MD5, SHA1,
SHA2 (SHA256/SHA512), SHA3 and BLAKE2.
It's designed to be an easy to use, graphical alternative to command-line tools
such as md5sum.
Some interesting features:
- Support for verifying checksum files from sfv, sha256sum, etc.
- Keyed hashing (HMAC)
- Parallel/threaded hash calculation
- Remote file access using GIO/GVfs
- File manager integration
- Small and fast, written in C
