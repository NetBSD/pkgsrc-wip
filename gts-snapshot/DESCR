This is the GTS library. GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated Surface
Library. It includes a number of useful functions to deal with
triangulated surfaces including, but not limited to, multi-resolution
models, Delaunay and Constrained Delaunay triangulations, set
operations on surfaces (intersection, union etc ...), bounding-boxes
trees for efficient collision and intersection detection, triangle
strips generation for fast rendering.
