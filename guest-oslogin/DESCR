The OS Login Guest Environment consists of the following main components:

- Authorized Keys Command which provides SSH keys from the user's OS Login
  profile to sshd for authenticating users at login.
- NSS Modules which provide support for making OS Login user and group
  information available to the system, using NSS (Name Service Switch)
  functionality.
- PAM Modules which provide authorization (and authentication if two-factor
  support is enabled) support allowing the system to use Google Cloud IAM
  permissions to control the ability to log into an instance or to perform
  operations as root (via sudo).

In addition to the main components, there are also the following utilities:

- google_oslogin_control is a shell script for activating/deactivating the OS
  Login components.
- google_oslogin_nss_cache is a utility for updating the local user and group
  cache.
