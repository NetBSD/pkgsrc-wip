 - Figure out [somehow] which files need to be installed.
 - Fix default path to monotone binary to point to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/mtn.
 - Deal with GPL annoyances wrt: which versions of qt4 are OK to build with
   versus which versions actually work.
 - Does this work with monotone-0.40?  The program's version check 
   fails with my current snapshot.
 - Anything else?

 Included in the snapshot tarball is a .qc file which can be used
 to generate a configure script using devel/qconf.
