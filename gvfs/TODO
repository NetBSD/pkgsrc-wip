# Fairly untested

This package needs to be tested further, before being imported back to the
main pkgsrc tree. It especially needs to be build-tested (at least) on
Linux where a lot of PLIST diffs are expected to happen there.

# gvfsd-fuse is known not to work on NetBSD

This is because NetBSD refuse(3) doesn't support non-root mounting but
gvfsd(1) relies on this specific functionality. gvfsd(1) launches
gvfsd-fuse(1) as a regular user, and it exits with an error. We should
probably implement fusermount(1) as a part of refuse(3).

Or maybe we can get away with just setuid-ing gvfsd-fuse?
