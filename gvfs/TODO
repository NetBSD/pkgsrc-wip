# Fairly untested

This package needs to be tested further, before being imported back to the
main pkgsrc tree. It especially needs to be build-tested (at least) on
Linux where a lot of PLIST diffs are expected to happen there.

# gvfsd-fuse is known not to work on NetBSD

This is because NetBSD refuse(3) doesn't support non-root mounting but
gvfsd(1) relies on this specific functionality. gvfsd(1) launches
gvfsd-fuse(1) as a regular user, and it exits with an error. We should
really implement fusermount(1) as a part of refuse(3).

Note that we cannot work around this problem by setuid'ing gvfsd-fuse,
because libdbus checks if the process is setuid'ed and if so it refuses to
connect to a bus provided thru an environment variable.

A possible workaround is to temporarily implement something equivalent to
fusermount(1) in gvfs, and use it until NetBSD natively supports it. Or
rather, NetBSD versions that don't support it go EOL.
