### gvfs' meson.build files uses install_rpath to embed rpath to
### ${PREFIX}/lib/gvfs. Unpatched Meson handles this just fine but
### alas... our Meson has a patch to kill the rpath fixup
### (patches/patch-mesonbuild_scripts_depfixer.py) and it renders
### install_rpath non-functioning. We can't simply get away with deleting
### the patch, because depfixer.py cannot inject a DT_RPATH that is longer
### than existing ones. (Have they considered using patchelf instead of
### hand-rolling their own ELF patcher?) To overcome the limitation they
### introduced on their own, Meson allocates a dummy rpath with the same
### length of install_rpath with every character replaced with 'X', like
### "-Wl,-rpath,XXXXXXXXXX", which doesn't begin with a '/' so our
### cwrappers remove them! Meson and our cwrappers fight against each other
### in a very indirect way, and the only around is to do this silly hack:
PKG_HACKS+=	rpath-fixup
LDFLAGS+=	${COMPILER_RPATH_FLAG}${PREFIX:Q}/lib/gvfs
