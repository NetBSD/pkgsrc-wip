Gnome Wave Cleaner is an application to aid in denoising (removing
hiss and clicks) from audio files.  It is primarily intended for
cleaning up recordings from vinyl albums.

Here is how the author describes gwc:

  WHAT IS IT?

  It is a result of never wanting to boot to MS windows again.  The
  only reason I had left was because I have this wonderful software to
  record digital audio, and the dehiss and declick using some very
  cool software (COOLEDIT 2000, and Declick by M. Paar), to do the
  audio restoration.

  I checked out some of the ongoing projects in linux, and either they
  crashed a lot or, didn't do what I needed, so I started this effort
  out of selfishness and also as a mechanism to learn the GNOME API
  for GUI programming.  A lot of the code shows the efforts of that
  learning curve, and could certainly be cleaned up, but I am
  personally pleased with the overall design.  The goals are simple --
  denoise, dehiss and amplify audio files in the Microsoft wave
  format, 16 bit only, stereo only, and assuming a sampling rate of
  44,100 hz.
