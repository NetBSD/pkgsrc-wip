o The package builds and uses a static library. It gets configured and built
  at build and install time.
o There are a few hard-coded `make'.
o A test for lrint is needed, maybe a config.h.in too and the necessary
  configure changes.
o Testing on other platforms needed.
o There might be something to do about gnome-core dependency

Needs to be updated to the gnome2 version, since gnome-core
has been removed from pkgsrc.
