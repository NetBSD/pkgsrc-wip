HasciiCam makes it possible to have live ascii video on the web. It captures
video from a tv card and renders it into ascii, formatting the output into an
html page with a refresh tag or in a live ascii window or in a simple text
file as well, giving the possiblity to anybody that has a bttv card, a linux
box and a cheap modem line to show a live asciivideo feed that can be
browsable without any need for plugin, java etc.

Features:
 - low bandwidth live cam "streaming"
 - command line settings
 - customizable refresh rate
 - amazing live mode
 - gives you the coolest .plan you ever had
 - draws nifty symbols on your face
