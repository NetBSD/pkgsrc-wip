HawkNL is a free, open source, game oriented network API released under the GNU
Library General Public License (LGPL). HawkNL (NL) is a fairly low level API, a
wrapper over Berkeley/Unix Sockets and Winsock. But NL also provides other
features including support for many OSs, groups of sockets, socket statistics,
high accuracy timer, CRC functions, macros to read and write data to packets
with endian conversion, and support for multiple network transports. NL has been
tested on Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE, Linux, Solaris, IRIX, AIX, BSDs, Mac OS.
There are also the two high level APIs, HawkNLU (NLU) and HawkVoice, which are
built on top of NL. It is NLU and HawkVoice that are most exciting, since they
give developers portable, easy to use alternatives to the Microsoft DirectPlay
(DPlay) and DirectPlay Voice APIs.
