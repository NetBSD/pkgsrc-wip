Nazghul is a computer role-playing game (CRPG) engine. The emphasis is not
on graphics or first-person squad-based stealth action. If you like roguelikes
or the top-down, 2d, turn-based CRPG's that disappeared in the early 90's then
this is for you.

Haxima is a role-playing game using the Nazghul engine.
