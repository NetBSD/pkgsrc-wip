--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING:
--------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you install hellanzb via one of the packaging systems
(FreeBSD ports, NetBSD pkgsrc-wip, Mac OS X darwinports). The latest port files 
and the python source tarball are available from:

http://www.hellanzb.com/distfiles

To alternatively install hellanzb manually (from the source tarball):

Prerequisites:

Unix O/S               E.g.: http://www.freebsd.org, http://www.apple.com/macosx
Python >= 2.3          http://www.python.org

Twisted >= 2.0         http://www.twistedmatrix.com *and*
Twisted Web            http://www.twistedmatrix.com/projects/web
  OR
Twisted = 1.3          http://www.twistedmatrix.com

par2cmdline =~ 0.4     http://parchive.sourceforge.net
rar or unrar =~ 3.41   http://www.rarlab.com

hellanzb requires the command line utilities "par2", and "rar" (or "unrar") to
be in your shell environment's PATH.

hellanzb can either be ran from its own directory, or to install it system wide,
simply run (as root) in the hellanzb directory:

    "python setup.py install"


CONFIGURING
--------------------------------------------------
o Copy <prefix>/etc/hellanzb.conf.sample to hellanzb.conf in the same directory
  (This is automatically done for you by the ports)

  The prefix is typically:
    /usr/local (FreeBSD) or
    /usr/pkg   (NetBSD) or
    /opt/local (Darwin)
    or the hellanzb directory if ran locally within it
    
o Open hellanzb.conf and edit the directories (PREFIX, DEST_DIR, etc) to your
  liking. The important directories are the QUEUE directory (where you'll put
  nzb files to add to the queue) and the DEST dir (where the finished files are
  placed)

o Configure your Usenet connection with a defineServer line. There may be
  multiple defineServer lines

o Edit the defineMusicType lines to match the music decompressors installed
  on your system (any defined music decompression command line utilities must
  be available in your shell environment's PATH)

o [Optional] Edit the growler configuration to enable Mac OS X Growl
  notifications


USING
--------------------------------------------------
Run hellanzb.py

Move .nzb files into the QUEUE directory

Watch hellanzb (or go do something else) download and process your nzb
archives, leaving the finished files in the DEST dir

Also, see the 'Safe Usage' section at the bottom of this file


MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------

o Make sure your terminal is at least 80 columns wide otherwise you may see
  download status lines scroll off the screen

o You can make hellanzb simply post process an already downloaded archive:

  "hellanzb.py -p ArchiveDirectoryName"

  In the case the archive contains password protected rars:

  "hellanzb.py -p ArchiveDirectoryName -P rarPassword"

  By default, the -p option will attempt to contact an already running hellanzb
  queue daemon via XML RPC. If the queue daemon is successfully contacted, it
  will handle the post processing work.

  If the queue daemon cannot be contacted, post processing will take place in
  the current process (and the process will exit upon completion)

  You can force -p mode to do the post processing work in the current process
  (and not attempt to contact the queue daemon) by also specifying the -L
  option:

  "hellanzb.py -Lp ArchiveDirectoryName -P rarPassword"
  
o Post processing happens automatically after archives are downloaded. In the
  case that an automatic post processor is interrupted by hellanzb exiting
  (such as from a CTRL-C), post processing will be resumed when hellanzb is
  restarted

o hellanzb logs its output to /var/tmp/hellanzb.log by default (this can be
  turned off in the configuration file)

o In the rare case that something unexpected happens, try reproducing it with
  Hellanzb.DEBUG_MODE (or hellanzb.py -d) enabled. This will produce a
  highly verbose DEBUG file that will contain any unexpected errors that were
  not picked up by the normal log file
