Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but includes
many graphical improvements and new game features. In it, you must maneuver
a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding
obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own trail.

There are five game modes available. Quest is the classical Nibbles, in
Death Match you start with very long tails and must kill your opponents, in
Kill'em All you must run over lemmings moving on the ground, in Time Cash or
Color modes you must collect money or pyramids of color. Heroes features 12
original sound tracks, 94 levels (in 10 different tile sets) plus a level
editor.

Heroes' source code (distributed under the GNU General Public Licence
version 2) originates from an original MS-DOS game but has been heavily
modified to enhance the portability. Some new features have been added and
MS-DOS support has been lost by the meantime. The original MS-DOS version
can still be found on the Internet but is unmaintained and should be
considered obsolete.
