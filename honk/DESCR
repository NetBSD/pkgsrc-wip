An ActivityPub server with minimal setup and support costs. Spend more
time using the software and less time operating it. No attention mining.
No likes, no faves, no polls, no stars, no claps, no counts. Purple
color scheme. Custom emus. Memes too. Avatars automatically assigned by
the NSA. The button to submit a new honk says "it's gonna be honked".
