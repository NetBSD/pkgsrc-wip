Hopefully I'll get to these soon.

1. Fix command line handling. e.g. use getopt_long. The current handling
is complicated and there is at least one core dump situation:

tubbs% /usr/pkg/bin/host 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
tubbs% /usr/pkg/bin/host -v
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
tubbs% /usr/pkg/bin/host -v www.cisco.com
Query about www.cisco.com for record types A
Query for A records done, 1 answer, status: no error
The following answer is not authoritative:
Answer section contains (1 record):
www.cisco.com           IN      A       198.133.219.25
