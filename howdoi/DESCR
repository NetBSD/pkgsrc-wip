Are you a hack programmer? Do you find yourself constantly Googling
for how to do basic programing tasks?

Suppose you want to know how to format a date in bash. Why open
your browser and read through blogs (risking major distraction)
when you can simply stay in the console and ask howdoi:

 $ howdoi format date bash
 > DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
