Some classes for generalized boolean operations. Starting with 0.1.0, this
package uses type families. Up to version 0.0.2, it used MPTCs with
functional dependencies. My thanks to Andy Gill for suggesting & helping
with the change. Thanks also to Alex Horsman for Data.Boolean.Overload and
to Jan Bracker for Data.Boolean.Numbers.
