This module provides a set of functions for building simple
command-line interfaces. It allows interfaces which collect values
(such as Integers, Dates, or other structured values), build lists of
values, and use simple menus. It is not intended to build complex
interfaces with full cursor control. It is oriented towards line-based
interfaces.
