Lucu is an HTTP daemonic library. It can be embedded in any Haskell
program and runs in an independent thread. Lucu is not a replacement
for Apache. It is intended to be used to create an efficient web-based
application without messing around FastCGI. It is also intended to be
run behind a reverse-proxy so it doesn't have some facilities like
logging, client filtering or such like.
