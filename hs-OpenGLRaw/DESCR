OpenGLRaw is a raw Haskell binding for the OpenGL 3.2 graphics system
and lots of OpenGL extensions. It is basically a 1:1 mapping of
OpenGL's C API, intended as a basis for a nicer interface. OpenGLRaw
offers access to all necessary functions, tokens and types plus a
general facility for loading extension entries. The module hierarchy
closely mirrors the naming structure of the OpenGL extensions, making
it easy to find the right module to import. All API entries are loaded
dynamically, so no special C header files are needed for building this
package. If an API entry is not found at runtime, a userError is
thrown.
