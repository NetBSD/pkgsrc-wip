The Quantum IO Monad is a library for defining quantum computations in Haskell
It can be thought of as an embedded language within Haskell,
and comes with functions for simulating the running of these quantum
computations. The distribution contains many example computations
written in QIO, including an implementation of Shor's algorithm.
