This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI. They were
designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces, so that hsc2hs can
extract from them all Haskell code needed to mimic such
interfaces. All Haskell names used are automatically derived from C
names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances of Storable, and
there are also macros you can use with C code to help write bindings
to inline functions or macro functions. Documentation is available in
package homepage:

http://bitbucket.org/mauricio/bindings-dsl

This package contains no Haskell code, only C header files designed
for hsc2hs.
