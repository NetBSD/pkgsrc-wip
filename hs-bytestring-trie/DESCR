An efficient finite map from (byte)strings to values.

The implementation is based on big-endian patricia trees, like
Data.IntMap. We first trie on the elements of Data.ByteString and then
trie on the big-endian bit representation of those elements. Patricia
trees have efficient algorithms for union and other merging
operations, but they're also quick for lookups and insertions.
