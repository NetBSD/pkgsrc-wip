Carp is a programming language designed to work well for interactive and
performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and
visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:

- Automatic and deterministic memory management (no garbage collector or VM)
- Inferred static types for great speed and reliability
- Ownership tracking enables a functional programming style while still
  using mutation of cache-friendly data structures under the hood
- No hidden performance penalties â€“ allocation and copying are explicit
- Straightforward integration with existing C code
- Lisp macros, compile time scripting and a helpful REPL
