Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
image generation and processing. The basic structure is a chalk board,
a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. Chalkboard
provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying,
function mapping, cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more
unusual ones.

Chalkboard Viewer is a portal into a dynamically updatable Board, via
an OpenGL window.
