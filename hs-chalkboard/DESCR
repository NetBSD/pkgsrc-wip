Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
image generation and processing. The basic structure is a chalk board,
a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. Chalkboard
provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying,
function mapping, cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more
unusual ones. Images can be imported into Chalkboard, as first-class
color chalk boards. Chalkboard also provides combinators for drawing
shapes on directly on boards. The system is based loosely on PAN, but
the principal image type, a Board, is abstract.
