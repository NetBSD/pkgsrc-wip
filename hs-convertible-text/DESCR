This is a port of John Goerzen's convertible package, intended to
distinguish between conversions which are guaranteed to succeed and
those which might fail. It uses the attempt package, which in turn
uses the failure package, so that this package is fully compatible
with the failure framework.

This package currently contains all of the typeclasses and instances
for convertible. However, as these features are ported to the
convertible package, this package will be left with only the instances
for converting to and from text types (String, ByteString (lazy and
strict) and Text (lazy and strict).

Be aware that conversions to and from bytestrings assume UTF-8
encoding. If a different encoding is desired, you can use a newtype
wrapper and declare an instance of ConvertAttempt or ConvertSuccess on
it.

The main module to import is Data.Convertible.Text.
