Synchronous and Asynchronous exceptions which are explicit in the type
signature. The first ones are very similar to Either and
Control.Monad.Error.ErrorT. The second ones are used for
System.IO.readFile and System.IO.hGetContents. This package is a
proposal for improved exception handling in Haskell. It strictly
separates between handling of exceptional situations (file not found,
invalid user input, see http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Exception)
and (programming) errors (division by zero, index out of range, see
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Error). Handling of the first one
is called "exception handling", whereas handling of errors is better
known as "debugging".
