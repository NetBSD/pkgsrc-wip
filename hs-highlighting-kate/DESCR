highlighting-kate is a syntax highlighting library with support for nearly
one hundred languages. The syntax parsers are automatically generated from
Kate syntax descriptions (http://kate-editor.org/), so any syntax supported
by Kate can be added. An (optional) command-line program is provided, along
with a utility for generating new parsers from Kate XML syntax
descriptions.
