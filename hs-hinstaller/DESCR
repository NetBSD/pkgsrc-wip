This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell
module during compilation. The files are then available to you through
functions which allows you to write installer-type applications which
write out the files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same
model as Java .jar files or executable zip or other file archives.

The current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However, it
does require that you have a C compiler installed which can be invoked
through cc.
