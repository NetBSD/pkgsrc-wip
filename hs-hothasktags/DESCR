hothasktags generates ctags files for Haskell, with knowledge of import lists
and qualified imports. It provides a smart go-to-definition for Vim, that almost
always gets it right in the presence of multiple names from different modules.

You will want to configure Vim to allow dots in keywords, because hothasktags
generates tags for qualified names. You can do this with:

 set iskeyword=a-z,A-Z,_,.,39

(The 39 is for the prime character)

Usage is easy, just give hothasktags the names of all the haskell sources you
want to index and redirect into a tags file. For example:

 find . | egrep '\.hs$' | xargs hothasktags > tags

will index all the hs files under the current directory.

hothasktags does not work with the emacs tag file format. Sorry.
