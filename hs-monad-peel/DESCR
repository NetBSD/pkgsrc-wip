This package defines MonadPeelIO, a subset of MonadIO into which
generic control operations such as catch can be lifted from
IO. Instances are based on monad transformers in MonadTransPeel, which
includes all standard monad transformers in the transformers library
except ContT. For convenience, it provides a wrapped version of
Control.Exception with types generalized from IO to all monads in
MonadPeelIO.
