Monad classes using type families, with instances for various monad
transformers, inspired by the paper /Functional Programming with
Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones, in Advanced
School of Functional Programming, 1995
(http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html).

This package is almost a compatible replacement for the mtl-tf package.
