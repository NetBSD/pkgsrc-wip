The library allows you to allocate memory in a region yielding a
regional pointer to it. When the region terminates all pointers are
automatically freed. Most importantly, a pointer can't be returned
from the region. So it's impossible to reference unallocated memory.

The primary technique used in this package is called "Lightweight
monadic regions" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh
Shan. See:
http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight

This technique is implemented in the regions package which is
re-exported from this library.

This library provides wrappers around all the Ptr functions from the
Foreign.* modules from base.
