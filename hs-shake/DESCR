Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
replacement for make. See Development.Shake for an introduction, including
an example. Further examples are included in the Cabal tarball, under the
Examples directory. The homepage contains links to a user manual, an
academic paper and further information: https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake

To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program that imports
Development.Shake, defines some build rules, and calls the
Development.Shake.shakeArgs function. Thanks to do notation and infix
operators, a simple Shake build system is not too dissimilar from a simple
Makefile. However, as build systems get more complex, Shake is able to take
advantage of the excellent abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and
easily support much larger projects. The Shake library provides all the
standard features available in other build systems, including automatic
parallelism and minimal rebuilds. Shake also provides more accurate
dependency tracking, including seamless support for generated files, and
dependencies on system information (e.g. compiler version).
