This package provides the standard Haskell list library reimplemented
to allow stream fusion. This should in general provide faster list
operations, and faster code for list-heavy programs. See the paper
Stream Fusion: From Lists to Streams to Nothing at All, Coutts,
Leshchinskiy and Stewart, 2007. To use, simply import Data.List.Stream
in place of Data.List, and hide list functions from the Prelude.
