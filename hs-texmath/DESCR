The texmathml library provides functions to convert LaTeX math formulas to
presentation MathML (which can be used in HTML) or OMML (Office Math Markup
Language, used in Microsoft Office). It supports basic LaTeX and AMS
extensions, and it can parse and apply LaTeX macros.

Use the test flag to install a standalone executable, texmath, that reads a
LaTeX formula from stdin and writes MathML to stdout.

Use the cgi flag to install a cgi script, texmath-cgi.
