Haskell bindings to the International Components for Unicode (ICU)
libraries. These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode
services on a wide variety of platforms.

Features include:
    * Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over
      efficiency and ease of use.
    * Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line
      boundaries.
    * Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character
      metadata.
    * String collation functions, for locales where the conventions
      for lexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric
      ordering of character codes.
    * Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between
      Unicode and over 220 character encodings.
    * Unicode normalization. (When implementations keep strings in a
      normalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings
      have a unique binary representation.)
    * Regular expression search and replace.
