vector-space provides classes and generic operations for vector spaces and
affine spaces. It also defines a type of infinite towers of generalized
derivatives. A generalized derivative is a linear transformation rather
than one of the common concrete representations (scalars, vectors,
matrices, ...).

Warning: this package depends on type families working fairly well,
requiring GHC version at least 6.9.
