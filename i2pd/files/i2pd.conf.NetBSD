## Configuration file for a typical i2pd user
## See https://i2pd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html
## for more options you can use in this file.

## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.

## Tunnels config file
## Default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.conf or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf
# tunconf = /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf

## Where to write pidfile (don't write by default)
pidfile = /var/run/i2pd/i2pd.pid

## Logging configuration section
## By default logs go to stdout with level 'info' and higher
##
## Logs destination (valid values: stdout, file, syslog)
##  * stdout - print log entries to stdout
##  * file - log entries to a file
##  * syslog - use syslog, see man 3 syslog
log = file
## Path to logfile (default - autodetect)
logfile = /var/log/i2pd/i2pd.log
## Log messages above this level (debug, *info, warn, error, none)
## If you set it to none, logging will be disabled
loglevel = info

## Path to storage of i2pd data (RI, keys, peer profiles, ...)
## Default: ~/.i2pd or /var/lib/i2pd
##
## In 2.18.0 version 'datadir' config variable is ignored by i2pd (known problem)
## So, on NetBSD, i2pd uses '/usr/pkg/var/i2pd' path by default
## Use --datadir option if you want to change this path
#datadir = /usr/pkg/var/i2pd

## Daemon mode. Router will go to background after start
daemon = true
## Run as a service. Router will use system folders like ‘/var/lib/i2pd’
service = true

## Specify a family, router belongs to (default - none)
# family =

## External IP address to listen for connections
## By default i2pd sets IP automatically
# host = 1.2.3.4

## Port to listen for connections
## By default i2pd picks random port. You MUST pick a random number too,
## don't just uncomment this

# nat = true

## Bandwidth configuration
## L limit bandwidth to 32KBs/sec, O - to 256KBs/sec, P - to 2048KBs/sec,
## X - unlimited
## Default is X for floodfill, L for regular node
# bandwidth = L

## Router will not accept transit tunnels, disabling transit traffic completely
## (default = false)
# notransit = true

## Router will be floodfill
# floodfill = true

[limits]
## Maximum active transit sessions (default:2500)
