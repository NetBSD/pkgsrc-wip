3blocks is a feed generator for text based status bars. It executes
your command lines and generates a status line from their output.
Commands are scheduled at configured time intervals, upon signal
reception or on clicks.

The generated line is meant to be displayed by the i3 window manager
through its i3bar component, as an alternative to i3status. This
program naturally works out of the box with the sway Wayland
compositor since it is a drop-in replacement for i3.

i3blocks is meant to be highly flexible but intuitive. No library
package is required, just output what your status bar expects, from
your favorite programming language and your preferred format.
