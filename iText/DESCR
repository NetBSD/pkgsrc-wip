The iText classes are very useful for people who need to
generate read-only, platform independent documents containing
text, lists, tables and images. The library is especially useful
in combination with Java(TM) technology-based Servlets: The look
and feel of HTML is browser dependent; with iText and PDF you
can control exactly how your servlet's output will look.

iText requires JDK 1.2. It's available for free under a multiple
license: MPL and LGPL.
