We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 78. It
updates to Unicode 17, including new characters and scripts,
emoji, collation & IDNA changes, and corresponding APIs and
implementations.

It also updates to CLDR 48 locale data with new locales, and various
additions and corrections.

In C++, there is a new set of APIs for Unicode string (UTF-8/16/32)
code point iteration that works seamlessly with modern C++ iterators
and ranges.

The C++ implementation of MessageFormat 2.0 is at CLDR 47 level
and remains in technology preview.
