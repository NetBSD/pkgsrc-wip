id3 mass tagger is a tool for manipulating id3 and id3v2 tags in multiple
files. It can generate tag fields from the filename and other variables,
and/or rename files, using an intuitive syntax.
id3 currently supports old-style ID3v1 tags, Lyrics3v2, as well as the
more complex ID3v2 format. This means its use is limited to audio files
which use these formats, i.e. MP3.
