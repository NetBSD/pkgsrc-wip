iGal is a Perl-based program that can generate and publish an
entire online picture show (HTML slides, thumbnails and index page
included) with just one command line invocation. If you've got a
directory (or several) full of image files that are waiting to be
put online and shared with friends, then iGal is for you.

iGal is well documented, flexible, and configurable through command
line options and HTML templates, specific to each gallery. Generated
slide shows include a JavaScript trick to preload the next image in
the slideshow - ideal for slow links.
