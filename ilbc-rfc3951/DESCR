iLBC specifies a speech codec suitable for robust voice communication over IP.
The codec is developed by Global IP Sound (GIPS).  It is designed for narrow
band speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s for 30 ms frames
and 15.20 kbit/s for 20 ms frames.  The codec enables graceful speech quality
degradation in the case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or
delayed IP packets.
