4 NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE "AS IS" AND WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT GIPS) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS LICENSE; NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. The Covered Code may be
incomplete; contain pre-release, untested, or not-fully-tested
works; and may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of
data. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of any Covered
Code is at Your sole and entire risk. No upgrades or support are
provided under this License.

5 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT IS GIPS OR ANY OF
ITS SUPPLIERS LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA,
LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF GIPS
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING
THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT DOES
GIPS'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY
BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) UNDER THIS LICENSE EXCEED THE AMOUNT
OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00).

6 TRADEMARKS.

This License does not grant any right or license to use the trademarks
or trade names "Global IP Sound", "GIPS", "iLBC", "SoundWare", or
any other GIPS trademarks, trade names, design marks, or logos
(collectively, "GIPS Marks"), except that "iLBC" may be used in
reference to the IETF Standard. No GIPS Marks may be used to endorse
or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
permitted by and in strict compliance with GIPS's trademark usage
guidelines.

7 OWNERSHIP.

GIPS retains all interests in the Original Code and any Modifications
made by or on behalf of GIPS ("GIPS Modifications"). GIPS Modifications
are not automatically subject to this License; GIPS may, at its
sole discretion, choose to license such GIPS Modifications under
this License or on different terms from those contained in this
License, or may choose not to license them.

8 TERMINATION.

8.1 This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply
with its terms and fail to cure such breach within 28 days of
becoming aware of the breach.

8.2 If You initiate a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against GIPS alleging that the Original Code or
any GIPS Modification directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
then any rights granted to You under this License terminate upon
60 days notice from GIPS unless You either (i) agree in writing to
pay GIPS a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
future use of Original Code and GIPS Modifications or (ii) withdraw
Your litigation claim.

8.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing,
and distribution of the Covered Code, and to destroy all copies of
the Covered Code that are in Your possession or control. Provisions
that by their nature should remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License, including but not limited to 2.2 "Limitations On
Patent License", 2.5 "Your Grant", 4 "No Warranty Or Support", 5
"Limitation Of Liability", 7 "Ownership", 8.3 "Effect Of Termination",
10.2 "Independent Development", and other applicable provisions of
Article 10, survive its termination. All end user license agreements
to the Covered Code (excluding distributors and resellers), if
validly granted prior to termination, survive any termination of
this License. No party is liable to any other for compensation,
indemnity, or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
License is without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any
party.

9 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
those rights set forth in this License.

10 MISCELLANEOUS.

10.1 Relationship. This License may not be construed as creating
an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other legal association
between You and GIPS, and You may not represent to the contrary,
whether expressly, by implication, or otherwise.

10.2 Inability To Comply. If it is impossible for You to comply
with any term of this License due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible and (b) describe the limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included with
all distributions of Source Code, and should be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

10.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License impairs GIPS's
right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it,
market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same
or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Original Code,
Covered Code, Modifications, Larger Works, or technology or products
You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

10.4 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by GIPS to enforce any provision
of this License may not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement
of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation that provides
that the language of a contract is construed against the drafter
does not apply to this License.

10.5 Severability. If any provision of this License is unenforceable,
that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
and reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable
so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of
this License continues in full force and effect.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if You are unable to comply fully with Section 2.1
or 2.5, this License terminates immediately and You must immediately
discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of
it that are in Your possession or control.

10.6 Dispute Resolution; Governing Law. This License is governed
by the laws of the United States and the State of California. Choice
of law rules do not apply, regardless of jurisdiction. Any litigation
relating to this License is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue
in San Francisco County, California, and You and GIPS hereby consent
to personal jurisdiction and venue therein with respect to this
License. Application of the United Nations Convention On Contracts
For The International Sale Of Goods is expressly excluded. The
losing party in any litigation is responsible for all costs,
reasonable attorneys' fees, and expenses.

10.7 Entire Agreement.  This License is the parties' entire agreement
with respect to its subject matter.

10.8 If You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the
following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have
requested that this License and all related documents be drafted
in English. Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous
les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.
