dear imgui (AKA ImGui), is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for
C++. It outputs vertex buffers that you can render in your 3D-pipeline enabled
application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no
external dependencies).

ImGui is designed to enable fast iteration and empower programmers to create
content creation tools and visualization/debug tools (as opposed to UI for the
average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and
thus lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

ImGui is particularly suited to integration in realtime 3D applications,
fullscreen applications, embedded applications, games, or any applications on
consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.
