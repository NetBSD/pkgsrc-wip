inetdxtra is a group of additional servers to add new protocols to
inetd/xinetd. These programs are all tiny, written in C with no
dependences and use well under 100Kb of RAM each. With them being
inetd servers, they only run when a request is made or a session
in progress.

Servers include:

in.www  -       An inetd based webserver with CGI support
in.proxy -      An inetd based HTTP proxy server
in.jabberd -    An inetd based jabber server
in.mvp -        An inetd based version of the mvprelay.c file
