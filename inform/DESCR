Inform is a programming language for creating interactive fiction,
using natural language syntax. Using natural language and drawing
on ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is
widely used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool
in the games industry, and in education, both at school and university
level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses on
digital narrative). It has several times ranked in the top 100 most
influential programming languages according to the TIOBE index.
Created in April 2006, it was open-sourced in April 2022.
