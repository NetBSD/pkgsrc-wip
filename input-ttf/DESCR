Input takes its aesthetic cues from monospaced fonts and pixel
fonts designed for consoles and screens, but casts off the technical
limitations that constrained them.

Like any good coding font, Input has generous spacing, large
punctuation, and easily distinguishable characters. Much attention
was paid to the size and positioning of symbols frequently used in
coding - curly brackets, less-than and greater-than signs, the @
sign - characters that can easily be afterthoughts in the type
design process.
