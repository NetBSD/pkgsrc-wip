Iosevka is a slender monospace sans-serif and slab-serif typeface inspired
by Pragmata Pro, M+ and PF DIN Mono, designed to be the ideal font for
programming.

Iosevka provides a large variety of variants. Prebuilt variants are listed
below. For all Monospace variants' packages, it will contain three spacing
variants.

* Default: The default variant with ligatures. Various symbols, like arrows
  and geometric, are wide (2-column).

* Terminal ("Term"): A narrower variant focusing terminal uses. Arrows and
  geometric symbols will be narrow to follow typical terminal usages.

* Fixed: Exact monospace font without ligatures and wide glyphs. Since some
  environments cannot interpret Iosevka or Iosevka Term as monospace, and
  have difficulties with ligatures included, you can use Iosevka Fixed as
  an alternative.

This package is "Iosevka Slab", Monospace, Slab fonts.
