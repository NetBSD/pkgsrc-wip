This package provides the iptables tools and libraries which provide
the userland interface to netfilter.

Netfilter is the firewalling subsystem for Linux 2.4.x or above
kernels. It provides stateful packet filtering, address translation
(including dynamic masquerading and port forwarding), and packet
manipulation.
