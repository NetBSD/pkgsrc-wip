IP Tables State (iptstate) was originally written to implement
the "state top" feature of IP Filter (see "The Idea" below) in
IP Tables. "State top" displays the states held by your stateful
firewall in a top-like manner.

Since IP Tables doesn't have a built in way to easily display
this information even once, an option was added to just have it
display the state table once.

Features include:
	- Top-like realtime state table information
	- Sorting by any field
	- Reversible sorting
	- Single display of state table
	- Customizable refresh rate
	- Open Source (specifically I'm using the zlib license)
