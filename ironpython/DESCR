IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language running under
.NET and Silverlight. It supports an interactive console with fully dynamic
compilation. It's well integrated with the rest of the .NET Framework and makes
all .NET libraries easily available to Python programmers, while maintaining
compatibility with the Python language.
