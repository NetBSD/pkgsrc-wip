irrXML provides forward-only, read-only access to a stream of non validated XML
data. It was fully implemented by Nikolaus Gebhardt. Its current features are:

* It it fast as lighting and has very low memory usage. It was developed with
  the intention of being used in 3D games, as it already has been.
* irrXML is very small: It only consists of 60 KB of code and can be added
  easily to your existing project.
* Of course, it is platform independent and works with lots of compilers.
* It is able to parse ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 text files, both in little
  and big endian format.
* Independent of the input file format, the parser can return all strings in
  ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 format.
* With its optional file access abstraction it has the advantage that it can
  read not only from files but from any type of data (memory, network, ...). For
  example when used with the Irrlicht Engine, it directly reads from compressed.
  zip files.
* Just like the Irrlicht Engine for which it was originally created, it is
  extremely easy to use.
* It has no external dependencies, it does not even need the STL.
