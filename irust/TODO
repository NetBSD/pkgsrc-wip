1. 'make replace' does not work:

❯ make replace
===> Replacing for IRust-irust
*** Error code 1

Stop.
make[1]: stopped making "replace" in /bd/pkgsrc/wip/irust
*** Error code 1

Stop.
make: stopped making "replace" in /bd/pkgsrc/wip/irust

2. 'pkglint' is not clean:

WARN: Makefile:4: Invalid character "@" in Git tag.
WARN: distinfo:45: Distfiles without version number should be placed in a versioned DIST_SUBDIR.
2 warnings found.
(Run "pkglint -e" to show explanations.)

https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust/releases/tag/irust%401.71.29 <- this is how the tag appears in the distribution, with the '@' sign. 

3. The package is called 'IRust-irust' instead of simply 'irust'.
