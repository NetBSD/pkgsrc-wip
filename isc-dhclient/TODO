make this build under NetBSD:
includes/cf/netbsd.h
and common/bpf.c and common/fddi.c to use NETBSD_FDDI
(see NetBSD's /usr/src/dist/dhcp)

Use MAKE_DIRS_PERMS for /var/db/dhcp
maybe should be named /var/db/isc-dhcp ?
does that conflict with other dhcp?

define in site.conf?
INSTALL
MANINSTALL

patch the Makefile.dist files to change all target to use SEDMANPAGES instead
(so nroff is not done)

about rc.d script comments, see TODO of wip/isc-dhcpd, as there are the same
questions/issues (mpasternak)
