make this build under NetBSD:
includes/cf/netbsd.h
and common/bpf.c and common/fddi.c to use NETBSD_FDDI
(see NetBSD's /usr/src/dist/dhcp)

Use MAKE_DIRS_PERMS for /var/db/dhcp
maybe should be named /var/db/isc-dhcp ?
does that conflict with other dhcp?

define in site.conf?
INSTALL
MANINSTALL

patch the Makefile.dist files to change all target to use SEDMANPAGES instead
(so nroff is not done)
