Log4j is a logging framework for Java.

With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the
application binary. The log4j package is designed so that these statements can
remain in shipped code without incurring a heavy performance cost. Logging
behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file, without touching
the application binary.
