CHARVA is a Java framework for presenting a "graphical" user interface,
composed of elements such as windows, dialogs, menus, textfields and buttons,
on a traditional character-cell ASCII terminal. It has an API based on that
of "Swing" (a.k.a. the Java Foundation Classes). Programmers familiar with
AWT and Swing will find programming CHARVA straightforward. User interfaces
can be designed on WYSIWYG IDEs such as Borland JBuilder and then easily
converted to CHARVA merely by changing the "import" statements to import the
"charva.awt and "charvax.swing" packages instead of the standard "java.awt"
and "javax.swing" packages.
