Crimson is a Java XML parser which supports XML 1.0 via the following APIs:

    * Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.1 minus the javax.xml.transform
		package. JAXP is a pluggable API that allows applications to access
		XML documents in a parser-independent manner. It endorses the industry
		standard SAX and DOM APIs and also adds a few classes under the
		javax.xml.parsers package to implement pluggability and utility methods.
		Note: the javax.xml.transform package hierarchy of JAXP is not
		implemented by Crimson. One implementation of javax.xml.transform can
		be found at Xalan Java 2.
    * SAX 2.0
    * SAX2 Extensions version 1.0
    * DOM Level 2 Core Recommendation
