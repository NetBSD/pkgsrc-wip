Echomine Muse API gives you one easy-to-use set of APIs and
frameworks for you to connect with other communication services
such as Gnutella, ICQ, to connect with other communication services
MSN, Yahoo, AIM, IRC, FTP, etc.  It implements the protocols and
then adds an extra layer on top of the protocols so that access to
all the services go through extra layer on top of the protocols so
that access to all the services go through extra layer on top of the
protocols so that access to all the services go through
one unified API (similar to how JDBC works).
