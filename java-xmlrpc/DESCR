Apache XML-RPC is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a
popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement
remote procedure calls.

Apache XML-RPC was previously known as Helma XML-RPC.
If you have code using the Helma library, all you should
have to do is change the import statements in your code
from helma.xmlrpc.* to org.apache.xmlrpc.*.
