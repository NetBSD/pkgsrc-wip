JC is a Java virtual machine implementation that converts class files into C
source files using the Soot Java bytecode analysis framework, compiles them
with GCC, and loads them using a built-in ELF object file loader. JC utilizes
the GNU Classpath class library and provides support for most features you would
expect such as reflection, user class loaders, etc.
