  * Test other browsers (currently tested: firefox-2.0.0.2)

  * Fix up installation without the plugin

  * files/cacerts stolen from a Sun JDK 1.6 installation -- is there
    a better source?

  * Figure out why some directories aren't properly removed on
    package deletion.

  * The JDK Makefiles use `gcc -w' to suppress all the static and
    inline warning messages from the build -- and there are lots!
    But `-w' is stripped by the pkgsrc wrappers for gcc.  Can we
    add this back in?  Is it worth it?

  * Stole INSTALL.tmpl and DEINSTALL.tmpl from sun-jre15 -- but these
    don't seem to be executed.
