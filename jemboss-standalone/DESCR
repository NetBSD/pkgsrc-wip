Jemboss is a java based interface to EMBOSS. It provides the advantage 
of being able to provide sensible EMBOSS defaults on-the-fly for a 
given  sequence or  for a given  input parameter. Jemboss can run the 
EMBOSS applications interactively or as a batch process. The progress 
of the batch processes are monitored by a job manager.
