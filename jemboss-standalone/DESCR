Jemboss is a java based interface to EMBOSS. It provides the advantage
of being able to provide sensible EMBOSS defaults on-the-fly for a
given  sequence or  for a given  input parameter. Jemboss can run the
EMBOSS applications interactively or as a batch process. The progress
of the batch processes are monitored by a job manager.
