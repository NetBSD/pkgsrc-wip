JGloss is an application for adding reading and translation
annotations to words in a Japanese text document. This can be done
automatically and manually. When a text document is first opened,
words will be looked up in dictionary files and the first reading
and translation (if any) is used to annotate the word. The user
can then edit the annotations: choose among the readings and
translations found in the dictionaries, enter own readings and
translations, remove annotations and add new annotations. The
document can be exported as plain text with annotations, HTML (with
support for the Ruby Annotation XHTML specification) or LaTeX.

The application is designed as a translation aid for people learning
Japanese. With some new document, you can first skim the text and
change the annotations to match the likeliest meaning of the word.
Then you can print/export the text with annotations and start
working on the details of understanding the text without having to
resort to a paper dictionary all the time.

JGloss is written in Java and should work on any computer with
support for the Java 2 Version 1.3/1.4 platform. It is distributed
