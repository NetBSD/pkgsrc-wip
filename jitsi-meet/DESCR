Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application
that uses Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, secure and
scalable video conferences.

This package provides the JavaScript application.  A full server
installation requires a webserver (typically nginx), an xmpp server
(typically prosody, perhaps ejabberd), Jitsi Videobridge
(chat/jitsi-videobridge), Jitsi Conference Focus (chat/jicofo) and
perhaps a TURN server (coturn).  Users do not need to install any
software, beyond a WebRTC-capable browser.
