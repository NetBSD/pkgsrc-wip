- Following pkgsrc norms, ensure that there are no loads from
  third-party sites in a default configuration, specifically avoiding:
    . google analytics
    . google openidconnect

- No longer pull data from the network (see www/gitea)

- Resolve chat/jitsi-meet/Makefile.common setting DISTINFO_FILE but
  not PATCHDIR.  Makefile.common is partly for all jitsi-world
  packages, and partly for things that use a specific distifile.
  Perhaps that should be split into two fragments so that e.g. jicofo
  would only include the larger-scope defines, and not have to undo
  the jitsi-meet-specific settings.
