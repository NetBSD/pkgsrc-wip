- Place more configuration files in $SYSCONFDIR/jitsi-meet
  (branding.json...)

- Excise google analytics, following pkgsrc's norm of removing
  phone-home code.

- Provide installation instructions.

- No longer pull data from the network (see www/gitea)

- Resolve chat/jitsi-meet/Makefile.common setting DISTINFO_FILE but
  not PATCHDIR.  Makefile.common is partly for all jitsi-world
  packages, and partly for things that use a specific distifile.
  Perhaps that should be split into two fragments so that e.g. jicofo
  would only include the larger-scope defines, and not have to undo
  the jitsi-meet-specific settings.
