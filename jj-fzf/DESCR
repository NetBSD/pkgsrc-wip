JJ-FZF is a text UI for jj based on fzf, implemented as a bash
shell script.

The main view centers around `jj log`, providing previews for the
`jj diff` or `jj obslog` of every revision.

Several key bindings are available to quickly perform actions such
as squashing, swapping, rebasing, splitting, branching, committing,
abandoning revisions and more.

A separate view for the operations log `jj op log` enables fast
previews of old commit histories or diffs between operations, making
it easy to `jj undo` any previous operation.
