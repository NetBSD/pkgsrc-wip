John the Ripper is a password cracker, currently available for UNIX, DOS,
WinNT/Win95. Its primary purpose is to detect weak UNIX passwords. It has
been tested with Linux x86/Alpha/SPARC, FreeBSD x86, OpenBSD x86, Solaris
2.x SPARC and x86, Digital UNIX, AIX, HP-UX, and IRIX.

The DOS and Win32 ports are done with DJGPP and Cygnus Developer's Kit,
respectively.

This is the community-enhanced version, which integrates lots of contributed
patches adding GPU support (OpenCL and CUDA), support for a hundred of
additional hash and cipher types (including popular ones such as NTLM, raw MD5,
etc., and even things such as encrypted OpenSSH private keys, ZIP and RAR
archives, PDF files, etc.), as well as some optimizations and features.
Unfortunately, its overall quality is lower than the official version's.
Requires OpenSSL. There are unofficial binary builds (by John the Ripper user
community members) for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X.
