Joker is a small interpreted dialect of Clojure written in Go. It is
also a Clojure(Script) linter. Joker has a fast start up, sane error
messages and stacktraces, and comes with batteries included: send HTTP
requests, read and parse JSON, work with the file system, etc. As a
linter, Joker can check for syntax errors, function arity mismatches,
unresolved symbols, unused namespaces, vars, bindings, and much more.
