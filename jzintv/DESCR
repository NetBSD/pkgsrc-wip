jzIntv  -- Joe Zbiciak's Intellivision(TM) Emulator for Linux

jzIntv is my attempt to write a complete Intellivision emulator
from scratch. I've always wanted to write an emulator from scratch,
and Intellivision seemed like a perfect choice: I enjoyed the
Intellivision immensely while growing up, there are few Intellivision
emulators around (and no GPL'd ones), and legitimate ROM images
are available.

The emulator's basic functions are mostly complete. CPU emulation
is essentially 100% complete, Sound is about 99.44% complete,
controller input is about 80% complete, and Graphics is about 50%
complete. To be playable, I need to complete the graphics emulation.

My goal is to produce the most accurate possible emulation of the
Intellivision system, including all widely available (and some
not-so-widely available) peripherals. This includes items such as
the ECS, Intellivoice, and so on. I'd also like my emulator to be
as portable as possible. I've already built versions under x86
Linux, Sparc Solaris, and even DOS! (SDL will also let me target
Windows and soon MacOS...) We'll see what happens.
