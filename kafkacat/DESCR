kafkacat is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka
>=0.8, think of it as a netcat for Kafka.

In producer mode kafkacat reads messages from stdin, delimited with a
configurable delimiter (-D, defaults to newline), and produces them to
the provided Kafka cluster (-b), topic (-t) and partition (-p).

In consumer mode kafkacat reads messages from a topic and partition and
prints them to stdout using the configured message delimiter.

There's also support for the Kafka >=0.9 high-level balanced consumer,
use the -G <group> switch and provide a list of topics to join the
group.

kafkacat also features a Metadata list (-L) mode to display the current
state of the Kafka cluster and its topics and partitions.

Supports Avro message deserialization using the Confluent
Schema-Registry, and generic primitive deserializers (see examples
below).

kafkacat is fast and lightweight; statically linked it is no more than
150Kb.
