Kamailio (successor of former OpenSER and SER) is an Open Source SIP
Server released under GPL, able to handle thousands of call setups per
second. Kamailio can be used to build large platforms for VoIP and
realtime communications - presence, WebRTC, Instant messaging and
other applications.  Moreover, it can be easily used for scaling up

FreeSWITCH or SEMS.

Among the powerful features: asynchronous TCP, UDP and SCTP, secure
communication via TLS for VoIP (voice, video, text); WebSocket support
for WebRTC; IPv4 and IPv6; SIMPLE instant messaging and presence with
embedded XCAP server and MSRP relay; asynchronous operations; IMS
extensions for VoLTE; ENUM; DID and least cost routing; load
balancing; routing fail-over; accounting, authentication and
authorization; support for many backend systems such as MySQL,
Postgres, Oracle, Radius, LDAP, Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, Memcached;
Json and XMLRPC control interface, SNMP monitoring.
