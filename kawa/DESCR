A framework written in Java for implementing high-level and dynamic languages
compiling them into Java bytecodes.

An implementation of Scheme, which is in the Lisp family of programming
languages. Kawa is a featureful dialect in its own right, and additionally
provides very useful integration with Java. It can be used as a cscripting
language, but includes a compiler and all the benefits of a real programming
language, including optional static typing.

Implementations of other programming languages, including XQuery (Qexo) and
Emacs Lisp (JEmacs)
