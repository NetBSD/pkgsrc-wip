KiCad 9.0.0 (2025-02-20)

The KiCad project is proud to announce the release of the next major
version of KiCad. Version 9 is packed with new features, improvements,
and hundreds of bug fixes. We hope you enjoy the new version! Head to
the KiCad download page to get your copy of the new version (note that
some packages may still be in the process of being released at the
time this announcement is published). Our thanks go out to everyone
who contributed to KiCad this past year. Whether your contribution was
large or small, writing code, submitting bug reports, improving our
libraries and documentation, or just supporting us financially: your
help made a difference.

In accordance with the KiCad stable release policy, version 8 of KiCad
will no longer be actively maintained, and we will release bug fix
versions of KiCad 9.x over the next year as we develop new features
for KiCad 10. Read on to see some of the highlights of the new
version!

Version 9 Changes

Most, if not all, of the new features as well as usability
improvements in KiCad 9 are described in a running thread on the KiCad
user forum. This thread is being kept reasonably up to date so users
running nightly builds know about new features to take for a test spin
and provide bug reports and feedback. Wayne Stambaugh also presented
them in his FOSDEM 2025 talk which is available to watch on the FOSDEM
website. This post highlights some of the major changes, but is not a
complete list. There were also hundreds of bug fixes, performance
improvements, and other smaller changes since KiCad 8. A full list of
issues addressed in KiCad 9 can be found on the milestone page on
GitLab.

By the Numbers

Source repository contributions

KiCad 9 was built with changes and additions from hundreds of
developers, translators, library contributors, and documentation
submitters. There were 4,870 unique commits made that changed code and
translations, which was roughly equivalent to Version 8. Our annual
development cycle continues to provide regular major releases for our
user base and attract new contributors and sponsors.

Improvements to the official KiCad libraries

2024 was another big year for the KiCad library team. With the help of
six new librarians joining the effort, the library gained almost 1500
new symbols, 750 new footprints, and 132 new 3D models along with
thousands of updates to fix or improve existing parts. The team
processed over 2309 merge requests. With even more people helping this
year, the team is able to address issues more quickly and has been
driving down the backlog of pending merge requests. We are excited to
see so many contributors join the library team and accelerate the
library’s growth.

General

Jobsets (predefined output jobs)

Mark Roszko contributed a feature that provides predefined sets of
‘jobs’—for example, plotting, exporting, and running DRC—on
schematics and PCBs. Independent jobset files are reusable as users
may want to create output pipelines that they can apply across their
projects for consistency. Jobsets can be run from the command line or
from the KiCad GUI.

Embedded files

Seth Hillbrand implemented embedding various elements in your
schematics, PCB layouts, footprints and symbols that were previously
linked to external files. This allows the creation of fully
self-contained KiCad files that do not rely on any external files such
as fonts or 3D models.

Bezier curve tool in all editors

A Bezier curve creation tool in the schematic and PCB editors was
implemented by John Beard. Like the arc tool, there are some guide
lines in the PCB editor and by default it chains them as tangent to
each other. The backspace key works in the same way as the arc
tool. The interactive edit guides are not (yet) in the schematic
editor (same for arcs). Beziers were already importable and editable
once imported, but now they can be created from scratch.

Multi-channel design support

Tomasz Wlostowski contributed support for creating multi-channel
designs. This allows the user to repeat PCB layout elements from one
channel to create identical copies.

Component classes

James Jackson has added a component class feature that allows grouping
of various symbols and footprints into classes that can have specific
design rules applied. Component classes are set on symbol in the
schematic editor and then apply to the footprints associated with
those symbols. Directive labels attached to a rule area can now take a
‘Component Class’ field. Symbols within the rule area will be
assigned that component class. The ‘Component Class’ field can be
set directly on symbols as well:

Symbols can have more than one component class, taking on any that are
defined directly on the symbol or any of its sub-units or from any
directive labels attached to any rule areas which contain the symbol.

In the PCB editor, component classes are attached to the symbol’s footprint:
comp class 3
Figure 7. Footprint with component class

There are three new DRC expressions / functions to support querying
component classes:

    (condition "A.ComponentClass == 'CLASS_1,CLASS_2'")

to test against the full list of component classes, where the
composite component class is a comma-delimited list in alphabetical
order),

    (condition "A.hasComponentClass('CLASS_1')")

to test if a footprint is part of a specific component class, and

    (condition "A.memberOfFootprint('${Class:CLASS_1}')")

to test if an item is part of a footprint in a specific component
class.

Table editing in schematic, symbol, and footprint editors

Thanks to the efforts of Jeff Young, tables can now be added to
schematic, symbol library, and footprint library editors putting them
on par with the PCB editor. Additional editing features were also
added to tables.

Custom ERC/DRC errors, warnings, and exclusion comments

Jeff Young added a feature that lets you create ERC/DRC errors and
warnings from text boxes and fields using the following text
variables:

    ${ERC_WARNING <custom title>}
    ${ERC_ERROR <custom title>}
    ${DRC_WARNING <custom title>}
    ${DRC_ERROR <custom title>}

Mouse scroll wheel actions

John Beard added a scroll action feature in the PCB, schematic,
footprint and symbol editors. Shift-Alt-Scroll is a primary function
and Ctrl-Alt-Scroll is a secondary function.

The current bindings are to use this to increment text, with the
rightmost “part” being primary and the next rightmost part being
secondary. For example, Shift-Alt-Scroll on “B2” goes to “B1” or
“B3”, Ctrl-Alt-Scroll goes to “A2” or “C2”. This is a bit
heuristic, but seems to work well for the obvious cases. As a side
effect of being able to detect the mouse being over name or number,
the symbol editor “Edit Pin” dialog now puts the initial focus on
the number field if the mouse was over it when double-clicked or the
‘E’ hot key.

* Footprint editor: pad numbers and text
* PCB editor: text
* Symbol editor: pin numbers or names (depending on mouse position)
  and text
* Schematic editor: labels and text

Continued Documentation Improvements

Graham Keeth has been hard at work updating KiCad’s documentation for
Version 9. Thanks to his work, most of the new features and changes in
KiCad 9 are already documented. In addition to documenting new
features, Graham has been improving all areas of the documentation
with updated screenshots, copy editing, and corrections. Our
documentation translators have also been working to update the
translated text so that up-to-date KiCad documentation is available in
more languages.

Other KiCad-wide changes

* The command line interface gained several new abilities, including
  raytracing 3D images
* Reverse mouse wheel zoom option
* Image reference points
* Expand/collapse all context menu entry in library editor tree panels
* Assign multiple net classes to a net
* Context menu copy from inspector report panels

* "Copy as Text" action which allows copying the text content of text
  items, fields, labels, tables, table cells, and dimensions

Schematic and Symbol Editors

Selection filtering

The schematic and symbol library editors now have object selection
filtering like the PCB and footprint library editors have thanks to
Jon Evans.

Sheet pin/hierarchical label synchronization tool

One of our newest core team developers Ethan Chien has contributed a
new sheet pin/hierarchical label synchronization tool. This tool
provides management of sheet pins and their associated hierarchical
labels instead of having to switch back and forth between the sheet
and schematic.

Net class rule areas

James Jackson added support for schematic net class rule areas that
allow users to draw a shape to which net class directives can be
attached to all nets defined by the shape.

Design blocks

Mike Williams contributed the schematic design blocks
implementation. This feature allows users to create libraries of
reusable schematic blocks. This feature will be extended to include
reusable PCB layout blocks in a future version of KiCad.

Net class color highlighting

There is a new option to apply net class coloring as a "highlight"
around the wire instead of just changing the color of the wire
itself. This handy usability improvement was contributed by James
Jackson.

Other smaller changes to the schematic editor

* Saving a symbol to another library in the symbol editor will now
  save all symbols it is derived from
* "Save As" and "Save Copy As" commands in symbol editor
* Warning when attempting to edit read only library with option to
  make an editable copy
* Option to not show hidden fields in the symbol editor
* Net navigator now displays all nets in the schematic
* Option to exclude symbols from simulation
* Import Eagle schematics with modules
* Symbol editor pin dragging
* Symbol alternate pin mode indicators
* Save derived symbols to different library
* ERC for local and global labels with the same name
* ERC for unconnected endpoints
* Support importing Altium ASCII schematic file format
* Sheets can be renamed from the hierarchy navigator
* Option to exclude symbols from simulation
* Option to show indicators on symbol pins with alternate definitions
* Ability to mark an entire sheet as "do not populate", "exclude from
  board/BOM", or "exclude from simulation"
* Option to plot the "do not populate" indicators
* Allow changing symbol unit in "Edit Reference Field" dialog
* Allow assigning multiple net classes to a single net
  * Introduces ordering of net classes
  * Allow net classes to have null properties (except default net class)
  * Effective net classes are constructed from non-null net class
    fields in net class priority order with default net class
    parameters always used as fallback
  * DRC checks for net class equivalence as requiring both items to
    have the same set of constituent net classes
  * DRC test net class name (A.netclass == 'my_netclass') against the
    comma-separated list of priority ordered constituent net classes
  * Add DRC function A.hasNetclass('my_netclass') to test if a given
    net class is assigned to an item
  * Schematic and PCB net class coloring taken from the effective
    aggregate net class for a net

PCB and Footprint Editors

IPC API

Jon Evans created a new API for the board editor based around
inter-process communication (IPC) that will eventually replace the
current Python wrapper interface. This interface will provide much
improved stability and API stability over the wrapper interface and
will be extended to support the schematic editor during version 10
development. For more information on the new API, please see the
developer documentation.

Zone manager

Ethan Chien has contributed a new zone manager feature which allows
easy preview and adjustment of zone priorities and other settings
without having to edit each zone individually to verify the result of
the changes.

Improved via tenting control

Control over via tenting on top and bottom sides at a board level and
per-via overrides was provided by Jon Evans. This change allows
complete control over via tenting compared to the options available in
previous versions of KiCad.

Layer pair presets

John Beard added some helpful features for working with layer pairs:
presets and a quick-switch list. “Enabled” pairs, along with the
currently-set pair if not itself a preset, can be cycled with the
“Shift+V” hot key.

Shape modification tool

Internal board cutouts usually cannot be manufactured with sharp
corners. John Beard created an aptly-named "Dog bone" tool to create
the proper shape(s) determined by the diameter of the tool used to
route the cutout.

Pad stacks

Thanks to the efforts of Jon Evans, KiCad now supports PTH pads with
different copper shapes on different layers. Pad stacks can be defined
with different shapes on the top, inner, and bottom layers, or with
unique shapes on every copper layer.

Interactive positioning tool

Another handy tool by John Beard allows users to position objects by
drawing a line and then defining what that line should be.

Another use is a more direct way to manipulate objects by first
getting them into a known position and then using Move Exact. It can
also be used to set alignment in one axis or the other.

The vector doesn’t have to be on either object, which allows direct
use of a dimension of something else as a movement for the selection.

Multiple track drag

Tomasz Wlostowski updated the push and shove router to allow dragging
of multiple tracks. While not the same as routing multiple tracks,
this change will greatly improve routing boards with complex buses.

Creepage design rule check

Fabien Corona implemented a design rule check for electrical creepage
clearances. The new rule syntax and the resulting DRC errors are shown
below.

    (rule HV_HV
       (constraint creepage (min 20mm))
       (condition "A.hasNetclass('A') && B.hasNetclass('B')")
    )

3D model export improvements

3D models can now be exported to XAO, STL, BREP, and PLY file formats
including silk screen and solder mask layers thanks to the efforts of
Aleksandr Shvartzkop.

Other changes to the PCB editor

* Net inspector panel
* Cursor snap indicators
* ODB++ export
* Option to plot pad outlines and numbers on fabrication layers
* Allow pasting text directly as text items
* Include silk screen and solder mask in 3D export
* Filter models to include/exclude in 3D export
* Plot all layers to a single PDF document with separate pages instead
  of to separate PDF files per layer
* Differential pair skew and acute angle design rule checks
* Optional skew DRC flag for independently checking differential pair
  skew rules
* Design rule failure clearance indicators
* Track solder mask removal
* Arbitrary reference for relative position tool
* Cursor snap indicators
* External dimension leaders
* Zone corner chamfering
* Option in position relative tool to use arbitrary reference point
  which can be snapped to objects
* Outset creation tool
* Polygon simplification tool
* Vias with per layer diameter annular rings
* Override locked footprints when updating PCB from schematic
* Allowing grouping of user defined layers as front/back pairs
* Exporting 3D models from command line interface with ray tracing is now supported
* Extend physical_clearance rule to apply between copper fills and footprint courtyards
* Improved rendering of plated through holes
* Inward facing dimension arrows
* 3D model export improvements
  * Option to fuse copper geometry together
  * Option to export copper on inner layers
  * Options to exclude board body or footprint models
  * Net filter (can be used to export a single net)
  *  Zone geometry approximation with arcs for faster processing and smaller file sizes

Other tools

* Tolerance calculations added to calculator tool regulator panel
