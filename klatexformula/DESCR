This application provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface
for generating images from LaTeX equations. These images can be
dragged and dropped or copied and pasted into external applications
(presentations, text documents, graphics...), or can be saved to
disk in a variety of formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, EPS, PDF, etc.). In
addition to the graphical user interface, a command-line interface
and a C++ library is provided to perform the same job.
