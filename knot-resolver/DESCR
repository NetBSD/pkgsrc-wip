Knot Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation
written in C and LuaJIT, both a resolver library and a daemon.
The core architecture is tiny and efficient, and provides a
foundation and a state-machine like API for extensions.
There are three modules built-in - *iterator*, *validator*,
*cache*, and a few more are loaded by default.
Most of the rich features are written in Lua(JIT) and C.
Batteries are included, but optional.
