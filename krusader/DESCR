Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager
for KDE Plasma and other desktops in the *nix world, similar to
Midnight or Total Commander. It provides all the file management
features you could possibly want. Plus: extensive archive handling,
mounted filesystem support, file transfers with (S)FTP, advanced
search module, copy/move queues, an internal viewer and editor,
directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, powerful batch
renaming, and much much more. It supports a wide variety of archive
formats and can handle other KIO slaves such as smb or fish. It is
(almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and
looks great on your desktop!
