The KSTest package is, basically, a C++ adaptation and autotools
repackaging of the code that accompanies the article Computing the
Two-Sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution by Richard Simard and
Pierre L'Ecuyer in the Journal of Statistical Software, vol 39,
issue 11, pp 1-18 (2011). It calculates, with high precision,
the cumulative probability and the exceedance (complementary
cumulative probability) of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic
