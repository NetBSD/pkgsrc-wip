Kubeconform is a Kubernetes manifests validation tool. Build it into
your CI to validate your Kubernetes configuration!

It is inspired by, contains code from and is designed to stay close to
Kubeval, but with the following improvements:

 * high performance: will validate & download manifests over multiple
   routines, caching downloaded files in memory
 * configurable list of remote, or local schemas locations, enabling
   validating Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) and offline validation
   capabilities
 * uses by default a self-updating fork of the schemas registry
   maintained by the kubernetes-json-schema project - which guarantees
   up-to-date schemas for all recent versions of Kubernetes.
