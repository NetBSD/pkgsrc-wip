Labwc is a wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for
Wayland, inspired by Openbox. It is lightweight and
independent with a focus on simply stacking windows well,
and rendering some window decorations. It relies on clients
for panels, screenshots, wallpapers, and so on to create
a full desktop environment. Labwc tries to stay in keeping
with wlroots and sway in terms of general approach
and coding style.
