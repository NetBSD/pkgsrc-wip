libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden  that provides a C++
stream output interface ( with operator << ) for creating Postscript
documents that can contain characters from any of the scripts and
symbol blocks supported in Unicode  and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout
engine. The library accomodates right-to-left scripts such as Arabic
and Hebrew as easily as left-to-right scripts. Indic and Indic-derived
Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and
Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by Pango and by the
OpenType fonts installed on your system. All of this is provided
without need for any special configuration or layout calculation on
the programmer's part.

Although the capability to produce Unicode-based multilingual
Postscript documents exists in large Open Source application framework
libraries such as GTK+, QT, and KDE, libLASi was designed for projects
which require the ability to produce Postscript independent of any one
application framework.
