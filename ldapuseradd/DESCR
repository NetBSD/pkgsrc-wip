ldapuseradd is a set of utilities that aid in the management and deployment of user accounts with support for plugins to manage requirements. The LDAP user management toolset uses a highly configurable user group profile system to distinguish targeted services. It is like an LDAP-based useradd/mod/del drop-in replacement with modular features. It scales well from small businesses to ISPs, hosting providers, and universities.
