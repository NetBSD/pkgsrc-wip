The LDC project aims to provide a portable D programming language
compiler with modern optimization and code generation capabilities.
The compiler uses the official DMD frontend to support the latest D2
version and relies on the LLVM Core libraries for code generation.

This is the 0.17 / ltsmaster branch. The last version of LDC that does not
require a D compiler to bootstrap.
