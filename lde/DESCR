lde  supports  the  three  most popular file systems under
Linux at the time of its  inception:  ext2fs,  minix,  and
xiafs.   It  also  has  minimal support for msdos FAT file
systems and a nofs system in which case lde will  function
as  a  binary  editor.   lde will attempt to automatically
detect the file system present on the device or file  when
it  is  started,  if it does not recognize the file system
present on the device, it will default to nofs.

lde allows you to view and edit  disk  blocks  in  hex  or
ASCII  mode,  view a block that contains directory entries
in a readable fashion, and view and edit formatted inodes.
lde  is  a  great  help when recovering deleted files (see
doc/UNERASE included with the lde  distribution  for  more
info).

The  device  parameter  is  a required option for lde.  If
ommitted, it will print a warning and refuse to start.  The
default  mode  for  lde is to use a curses interface; this
can be overriden by some of the options listed below.
