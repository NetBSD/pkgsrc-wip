lhs2TeX is a preprocessor to generate LaTeX code from literate Haskell sources.

lhs2TeX includes the following features:

    * Different styles to process your source file: for instance, "tt"
      style uses a monospaced font for the code while still allowing you to
      highlight keywords etc, whereas "poly" style uses proportional fonts
      for identifiers, handles indentation nicely, is able to replace binary
      operators by mathematical symbols and take care of complex horizontal
      alignments.
    * Formatting directives, which let you customize the way certain
      tokens in the source code should appear in the processed output.
    * A liberal parser that can handle most of the language
      extensions; you don't have to restrict yourself to Haskell 98.
    * Preprocessor-style conditionals that allow you to generate
      different versions of a document from a single source file (for
      instance, a paper and a presentation).
    * Active documents: you can use Haskell to generate parts of the
      document (useful for papers on Haskell).
    * A manual explaining all the important aspects of lhs2TeX.
