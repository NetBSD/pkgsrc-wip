2. Solaris using the gcc compiler
3. Windows using Metrowerks CodeWarrior
4. MacOS 9 using Metrowerks CodeWarrior
5. OpenBSD using the gcc compiler
6. Cygwin using the gcc compiler

libGenome can access sequence data in several different file formats:

1. Reads and writes Multi-FastA files, designated by a '.fas' file extension
2. Reads and writes GenBank flat file database entries
3. Reads DNAStar '.SEQ' file format
4. Reads and writes raw sequence data
5. Reads ABI file format

libGenome can manipulate sequence data in the following ways:
Append, Truncate, Erase subsequences, Insert subsequences, Reverse, Complement,
Ambiguity sensitive and insensitive comparison, Translate DNA to RNA, DNA to
Protein, RNA to DNA, RNA to Protein, and vice versa.
