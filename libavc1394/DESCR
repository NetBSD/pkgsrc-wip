libavc1394 is a programming interface to the AV/C (Audio/Video
Control) specification from the 1394 Trade Assocation. This is used
to control the tape transport mechanism on DV camcorders. It provides
the libavc1394 and librom1394 libraries.

This package includes a command-line utility called dvcont that
lets you send control commands via an IEEE1394 link to a device
that implements these AV/C specifications. (It is a remote control
for a DV camera used via Firewire.)
