libavc1394 is a programming interface to the AV/C (Audio/Video
Control) specification from the 1394 Trade Assocation. This is used
to control the tape transport mechanism on DV camcorders and provides
camera capabilities discovery and VTR control. This package provides
the libavc1394 and librom1394 libraries.

This package includes a command-line utility called dvcont that
lets you send control commands via an IEEE1394 link to a device
that implements these AV/C specifications. (It is a remote control
for a DV camera used via Firewire.)
