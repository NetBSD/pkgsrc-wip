# libbacktrace

A C library that may be linked into a C/C++ program to produce
symbolic backtraces

Initially written by Ian Lance Taylor <iant@golang.org>.

This is version 1.0.
It is likely that this will always be version 1.0.

The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and
used to produce symbolic backtraces.
Sample uses would be to print a detailed backtrace when an error
occurs or to gather detailed profiling information.
In general the functions provided by this library are async-signal-safe,
meaning that they may be safely called from a signal handler.

The libbacktrace library is provided under a BSD license.
See the source files for the exact license text.

The public functions are declared and documented in the header file
backtrace.h, which should be #include'd by a user of the library.
