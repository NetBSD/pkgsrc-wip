A heterogeneous C library of interesting numeric functions.

This library provides:

   * a function for rounding floating point values to a specific number
     of digits
   * several pseudo-random number generators, including the Mersenne
     Twister, various algorithms by Marsaglia, and ISAAC
   * least common multiple and greatest common denominator functions
   * a few trigonometry functions for finding the inversions of hyperbolic
     sine, cosine, and tangent

This library is also used by libevocosm, which is in turn the foundation for
Acovea, used to determine optimal compiler optimizations.
