The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual
machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build
them.

This package contains the LLVM low level support for the C++ standard library.
Features and Goals includes:
Correctness as defined by the C++11 standard.
Provide a portable sublayer to wase the porting of libc++.
On Mac OS X, be ABI compatible with the existing low-level support.
libc++abi is know to work on Darwin platform using clang.
