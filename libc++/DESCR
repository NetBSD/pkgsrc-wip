The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual
machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build
them.

This package contains the LLVM libc++ C++ standard library.
Features and Goals includes:
Correctness as defined by C++11 standard.
Fast execution.
Minimal memory use.
Fast copile time.
ABI compatibility with gcc's libstdc++ for low-level features.
Such as exception objects, rtti and memory allocation.
