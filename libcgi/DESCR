LibCGI is a library written from scratch to easily make CGI
applications in C.  There are a lot of functions like string
manipulation, session and cookie support, GET and POST methods
manipulation etc..., to help you to quickly write powerful CGI
programs.

There are some examples as well, so you can understand easily
how the library works.
