libclc is an open source implementation of the library requirements of
the OpenCL C programming language, as specified by the OpenCL 1.1
Specification. The following sections of the specification impose
library requirements:

    6.1: Supported Data Types
    6.2.3: Explicit Conversions
    6.2.4.2: Reinterpreting Types Using as_type() and as_typen()
    6.9: Preprocessor Directives and Macros
    6.11: Built-in Functions
    9.3: Double Precision Floating-Point
    9.4: 64-bit Atomics
    9.5: Writing to 3D image memory objects
    9.6: Half Precision Floating-Point

libclc is intended to be used with the Clang compiler's OpenCL frontend.

libclc is designed to be portable and extensible. To this end, it
provides generic implementations of most library requirements,
allowing the target to override the generic implementation at the
granularity of individual functions.

libclc currently supports PTX, AMDGPU, SPIRV and CLSPV targets, but
support for more targets is welcome.
