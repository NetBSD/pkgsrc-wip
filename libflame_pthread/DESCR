libflame is a portable library for dense matrix computations, providing much
of the functionality present in LAPACK, developed by current and former
members of the Science of High-Performance Computing (SHPC) group in the
Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at The University
of Texas at Austin. libflame includes a compatibility layer, lapack2flame,
which includes a complete LAPACK implementation.


This variant builds libflame with pthread support.
