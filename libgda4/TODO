- build for other db providers

bdb does contact but not browse the data,
in a readable form after "select * from data;".

ldap, mdb, mysql and postgres is checked and does work:
Gnome->System->Database Access Properties,
create Data Source,
double-click created Data Source,
push Test or Browse.

that build was done w/ these options:
PKG_OPTIONS.libgda4+=bdb jdbc ldap mdb mysql postgres web
PKG_OPTIONS.libgda4+=fam gui ui xslt

- i can image people want them non-inline libgda-db_name pkgs,
  given existing pkg distribution and deploy|install systems.
  for now i'd say, get them providers working from an inline build first.
  given, i think, the libgda build process changed itself,
  into a 2step build process
  (first supporting libs, then actual provider, this all in-tree).

Only built against Berkeley DB 5.

The GDA provider for MDB is checked to work but
does not show during configure and
GNU gettext Intl libraries should be handled.
