The libgrass package consists of the majority of the GRASS libgis, and
libdatetime library build as a standalone shared library suitable for use
by non-GRASS applications wishing to read and write GRASS databases.  Some
additional functions have been added to simplify library initialization and
data access by non-GRASS applications.  

While libgrass is currently only suitable for accessing GRASS raster cells,
and associated support files, it is hoped that future revisions will include
support for vector files, and other data elements stored within the GRASS
database.
