libGringotts is a small, easy-to-use, thread-safe C library originally developed
for Gringotts; its purpose is to encapsulate data (generic: ASCII, but also
binary data) in an encrypted and compressed structure, to be written to a file
or used elseway. It uses strong encryption algorithms, to ensure the data are as
safe as possible, and allows the user to have the complete control over all the
algorithms used in the process
