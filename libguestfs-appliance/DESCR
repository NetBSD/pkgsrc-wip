This is the "fixed appliance", a pre-built binary appliance for libguestfs.

Internally, libguestfs is implemented by running an appliance (a special type
of small virtual machine) using qemu(1). Qemu runs as a child process of the
main program.

Inside the appliance is a Linux kernel and a complete stack of userspace
tools (such as LVM and ext2 programs) and a small controlling daemon called
"guestfsd". The library talks to "guestfsd" using remote procedure calls (RPC).
There is a mostly one-to-one correspondence between libguestfs API calls and
RPC calls to the daemon. Lastly the disk image(s) are attached to the qemu
process which translates device access by the appliance's Linux kernel into
accesses to the image.
