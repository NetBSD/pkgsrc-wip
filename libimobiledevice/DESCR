libimobiledevice is a cross-platform software library that talks the
protocols to support iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Apple TV devices.  Unlike
other projects, it does not depend on using any existing proprietary
libraries and does not require jailbreaking. It allows other software to
easily access the device's filesystem, retrieve information about the device
and it's internals, backup/restore the device, manage SpringBoardÂ® icons,
manage installed applications, retrieve addressbook/calendars/notes and
bookmarks and (using libgpod) synchronize music and video to the device. The
library is in development since August 2007 with the goal to bring support
for these devices to the Linux Desktop.
