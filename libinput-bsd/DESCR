libinput is a library that provides a full input stack for display servers
and other applications that need to handle input devices provided by the
kernel.

libinput provides device detection, event handling and abstraction to
minimize the amount of custom input code the user of libinput needs to
provide the common set of functionality that users expect. Input event
processing includes scaling touch coordinates, generating
relative pointer events from touchpads, pointer acceleration, etc.

This repository fork from https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput.
It is an attempt to extend libinput so that it works with wscons(4) and
kqueue(2) and thus on OpenBSD and NetBSD.
