libmpq is a library which can be easily used in own applications
to extract, create or manipulate MoPaQ mpq archives.

MPQ, or MoPaQ, is a proprietary archive format created by Mike
O'Brien, the man hailed as Blizzard's multiplayer engine genius,
back in 1996 as a general purpose archive for use with Diablo.
The archive format is used by many Blizzard titles like Diablo,
Diablo 2, Starcraft, Warcraft 2: BNE, a newer version in Warcraft
3 and World of Warcraft (WoW).
