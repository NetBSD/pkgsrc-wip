From the homepage:

"libneural is an extremely tiny library for creating a software
three layer backpropagation neural network.
This is useful for a very wide variety of pattern recognition
and classification problems. It is written in C++, based on the
standard algorithm with NO fancy features like bias terms or
momentum (which I tried and found to be pretty useless for my
application anyway)."
