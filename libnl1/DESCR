Collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink protocol based Linux
kernel interfaces.

Netlink is a IPC mechanism primarly between the kernel and user space
processes. It was designed to be a more flexible successor to ioctl to
provide mainly networking related kernel configuration and monitoring
interfaces.
