Portable C++ library that is used to generate coherent noise, a type
of smoothly-changing noise. libnoise can generate Perlin noise, ridged
multifractal noise, and other types of coherent-noise.

Coherent noise is often used by graphics programmers to generate
natural-looking textures, planetary terrain, and other things.
