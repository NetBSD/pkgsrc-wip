The Linux-NTFS project aims to bring full support for the NTFS filesystem to the
Linux operating system.  The ntfsprogs package currently consists of a static
library and utilities such as mkntfs, ntfscat, ntfsls, ntfsresize, and
ntfsundelete (for a full list of included utilities see man 8 ntfsprogs after
installation).
