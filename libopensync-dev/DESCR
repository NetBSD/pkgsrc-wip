The OpenSync project is an ongoing effort to create a synchronization framework
that will be a platform independent, general purpose synchronization engine
utilizing modular plugins for content formats and different kind of connection
types. OpenSync's modularity should allow it to be extended easily to new
devices and purposes without radically changing the architecture itself,
allowing it to support wide variety of devices used today and in the future.

Even being a general purpose framework that keeps the doors open for many use
cases, OpenSync's main and most practical goal is to create a solution to
synchronize PIM (Personal Information Management - addressbook contacts,
calendar events and tasks, personal notes, etc) data between mobile devices like
mobile phones, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant), desktop computer PIM tools and
-services.

OpenSync is a successor of project Multisync, created by the same people.
Multisync's development stalled and it is no longer maintained, so users using
it should look to upgrade to OpenSync when possible. The combined project
history of these projects is long and currently the future looks bright for
achieving the original goals.
