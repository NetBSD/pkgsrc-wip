This is a VERY EXPERIMENTAL plugin for syncing with Motorola phones
using the AT command set. It supports syncing phonebook and calendar
entries (ie. the contact and event object types). It will most
likely mess up the data on your phone and any other members of the
sync group, due to the limited data that can be stored on the phone.
Use with caution and make backups!
