liboqs is part of the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project led by Douglas
Stebila and Michele Mosca, which aims to develop and integrate into
applications quantum-safe cryptography to facilitate deployment and
testing in real world contexts. In particular, OQS provides prototype
integrations of liboqs into TLS and SSH, through OpenSSL and OpenSSH.
