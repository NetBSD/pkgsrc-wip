This package contains a set of C-language libraries that form the core
infrastructure of many Osmocom Open Source Mobile Communications projects.

Historically, a lot of this code was developed as part of the OpenBSC project,
but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to (at least) other
programs that we develop in the sphere of Free Software / Open Source mobile
communications.
