OSTree is an upgrade system for Linux-based operating systems that
performs atomic upgrades of complete filesystem trees. It is not a
package system; rather, it is intended to complement them. A primary
model is composing packages on a server, and then replicating them
to clients.

The underlying architecture might be summarized as "git for operating
system binaries". It operates in userspace, and will work on top
of any Linux filesystem. At its core is a git-like content-addressed
object store with branches (or "refs") to track meaningful filesystem
trees within the store. Similarly, one can check out or commit to
these branches.

Layered on top of that is bootloader configuration, management of
/etc, and other functions to perform an upgrade beyond just replicating
files.

You can use OSTree standalone in the pure replication model, but
another approach is to add a package manager on top, thus creating
a hybrid tree/package system.
