This package provides numeric types of twice the precision
of IEEE double (106 mantissa bits, or approximately 32 decimal 
digits) and four times the precision of IEEE double (212 
mantissa bits, or approximately 64 decimal digits).
Due to features such as operator and function overloading, 
these facilities can be utilized with only minor modifications to 
conventional C++ and Fortran-90 programs.
