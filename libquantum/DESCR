libquantum is a C library for the simulation of a quantum
computer. Based on the principles of quantum mechanics, it provides an
implementation of a quantum register. Basic operations for register
manipulation such as the Hadamard gate or the Controlled-NOT gate are
available through an easy-to-use interface. Measurements can be
performed on either single qubits or the whole quantum register.
