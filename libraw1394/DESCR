libraw1394 is a supported interface to the Linux kernel side raw1394
of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to
the connected 1394 buses to user space.  Through libraw1394/raw1394,
applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes
without requiring a Linux kernel driver for the protocol in question.

This package also includes tools for listening to IEEE 1394 isochronous
channels, sending IEEE 1394 isochronous packets, and testing Linux IEEE
1394 subsystem (through libraw1394).
