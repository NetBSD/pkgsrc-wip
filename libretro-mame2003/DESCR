Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

MAME is the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. This is based on MAME 0.78
with backported patches for performance and compatibility improvements. This
core is a popular choice for the Raspberry Pi family and other low-powered
hardware because it supports most 2D-era arcade games and a broad set of
features without requiring as much processor and memory resources as later
MAME cores.
