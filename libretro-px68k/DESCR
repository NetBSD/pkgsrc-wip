Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

PX68k (Portable xkeropi PRO-68K) is a portable and fast emulator for
the Sharp X68000 series of home computers.

The Sharp X68000 was released exclusively in Japan in 1987. It was a
powerful machine for its time and saw a great number of arcade ports,
exclusive titles and doujin/indie games developed for it, even years
after the last model was launched in 1993.
