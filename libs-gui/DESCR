The GNUstep gui library is a library of graphical user interface classes
written completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based
upon Apple's Cocoa framwork (which came from the OpenStep
specification).  These classes include graphical objects such as
buttons, text fields, popup lists, browser lists, and windows; there are
also many associated classes for handling events, colors, fonts,
pasteboards and images.
