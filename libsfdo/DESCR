The freedesktop.org specifications are sometimes ambiguous
in their requirements, leaving room for interpretation.
libsfdo tries to follow them as closely as possible nonetheless,
except for cases when doing so would add too much complexity for
no benefit and/or result in suboptimal behavior. Additionally,
libsfdo is much stricter than other implementations, so it may
refuse to process non-conformant desktop entry files or icon themes.
