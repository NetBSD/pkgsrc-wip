On many platforms terminal emulators need some privilege for
some functionalities. Especially, they need root privilege on
BSDs to prevent other users from peeking user's input. With
libspt you can drop all privileges of your terminal
emulator. Additionally libspt saves terminal emulator writers
many portability related headaches. (Yes, there is many
headaches.)

From libspt-0.2 it also provides a minimal
termios(termio/sgtty) wrapper functionality. It does not
support any customization nor complex settings but enables you
to implement easiest functionalities portably with least work.
