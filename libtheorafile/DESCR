This is Theorafile, a library for quickly and easily decoding Ogg Theora
videos.

Theorafile was written to be used for FNA's VideoPlayer. We access this
library via Theorafile#, which you can find in the 'csharp/' directory.

Theorafile depends solely on the C runtime. libogg, libvorbis, and
libtheoradec are statically linked into Theorafile.
