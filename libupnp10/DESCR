The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Software Development Kit (SDK) v1.0 for
Linux is an SDK for development of UPnP device and control point applications
for Linux.  It consists of the core UPnP protocols along with a UPnP-specific
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) parser supporting the Document Object Model
(DOM) Level 1 API and an optional, integrated mini web server for serving UPnP
related documents.
