The USB serial I/O library (LIBUSBSIO) is a library and associated
API provided for programmers to develop host-side applications to
communicate with serial I/O devices connected to via the USB bridge
on LPC-Link2 and MCU-Link debug probes on supported NXP microcontroller
evaluation boards. The standalone MCU-Link Pro debug probe is also
supported. The LIBUSBIO library converts all API calls into USB
messages which are transferred to the debug probe, which in turn
communicates a target devices via I2C, SPI or GPIO interfaces. To
make the USB device install free on host systems, LPCUSBSIO uses
USB-HID class as the transport mechanism. The LIBUSBSIO library
may also be used with the MCUXpresso SEC provisioning tools and
the NXP Secure Provisioning SDK.
