Vidstab is a video stabilization library which can be plugged-in
with Ffmpeg and Transcode.

A video acquired using a hand-held camera or a camera mounted on
a vehicle, typically suffers from undesirable shakes and jitters.
Activities such as surfing, skiing, riding and walking while shooting
videos are especially prone to erratic camera shakes. Vidstab
targets these video contents to help create smoother and stable
videos.
