The LibXDiff package provides file differential library support functions.
It implements basic and yet complete functionalities to create and apply
file differences (patches) to both binary and text files. The library
uses memory files as file abstraction to achieve both performance and
portability. The proprietary output format of the binary patch file is
binary and it is basically a collection of copy and insert commands. The
text file differential output uses the raw unified output format (without
the header).
