Libzeep was developed to make it easy to create SOAP servers. And since working
with SOAP means working with XML and no decent C++ XML library existed on my
radar I've created a full XML library as well.
The XML part of libzeep consists of a validating parser, a DOM(-like) node
implementation, an XPath search engine and a XML writer/formatter. The
validation works based on DOCTYPE definitions, XML schema support will be added
in a later release.
