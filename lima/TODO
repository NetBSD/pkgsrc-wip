When trying to run default template via `limactl start` the Ubuntu Linux kernel
panics with:

This is probably the same of <https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/84>.

Investigate why Docker does no longer work out of the box with alpine (it worked
with lima-0.19.1!).

Apart that, mostly importable, some bits to investigate documented here
in order that it works out of the box in NetBSD.

The following networks is probably needed and/or we should figure out how to
just default to that in NetBSD, copypasting `~/.lima/_config/networks.yaml`
(not super-sure if that's really needed or "shared" will be picked up
automatically, double-check!):

```yaml
networks:
  shared:
    mode: shared
    gateway: 192.168.105.1
    dhcpEnd: 192.168.105.254
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
```

NetBSD only supports `reverse-sshfs`, the following is needed in
`~/.lima/_config/default.yaml` (for that maybe we can use similar SUBST
logic that we already have):

```
mountType: reverse-sshfs
```
