LingoTeach is a language teaching program. It allows you to learn
languages by seeing translations next to each other, and by listening
to people talking the native languages. At the moment LingoTeach
supports 16 languages, consisting of various lessons.

LingoTeach's core consists of two parts: An intuitive to use user
interface and the core library, LibLingoTeach.  Those both were
made in the hope that they will be useful for people learning
foreign languages or creating own language teaching applications.

The LingoTeach language teaching application
currently has the following features:
  * Multiple lesson support. Use and learn from several different
    lessons at the same time
  * Multilanguage supprt. You can learn more than one language at
    the same time.
  * Search and browse as well as editing features. Fit existing
    lessons to your needs, search lessons for specific keywords,
    languages, etc.
  * Sound support. Listen to native speakers, create own sound
    snippets and add them easily to your lessons or share them with
    other people.
  * Plugin supprt. Write own extensions and plugins for LingoTeach.

All components, which are shipped with those both packages are free
software, licensed under the GNU GPL. It can be possible, that
components (e.g. a plugin) have a different license than the GPL,
but the components you can download here are proven to be free.
