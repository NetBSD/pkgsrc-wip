        o Fix remaining packages to install documentation into
          share/doc instead of share/gtk-doc (usually,
                CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --with-html-dir=${PREFIX}/share/doc/html
          does the trick; additionally, one might set
                CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --enable-gtk-doc=no
          to avoid a gtk-doc dependency if html documentation is
          shipped with the package). Please fill in GNOME bug
          reports if any of the packages do not honor these
          configuration options and/or do not ship with pregenerated
          html documents.
