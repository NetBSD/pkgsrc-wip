gcc-3.3.3 doesn't allow syntax used in files asm/byteorder.h and
linux/byteorder/swab.h, which is included by the previous one.
for example:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/2/23/117
http://securityfocus.com/archive/89/355405/2004-02-22/2004-02-28/0

need to patch this

should this install include/linux/config/* ?

should this install include/linux/compile.h ?

maybe should remove any include/asm symlink and recreate

maybe could have seperate ${PREFIX}/include/asm-generic         
directory (but maybe that is a waste of un-needed headers)
and then have include/asm and have symlink to include/asm-${LOWER_ARCH}

should put include/asm-generic, include/asm, include-${LOWER_ARCH}
and include/linux as @dirrm in PLIST.common
