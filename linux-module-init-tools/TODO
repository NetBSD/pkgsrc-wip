New linux kernel needs these newer module utilities, but if system also
has old kernel, it will need modutils. So maybe have an old-modutils
package too with everything with .old suffix??

is it okay to share same rc.d script name as modutils package?

3) If running for the first time, you might want to convert your old
   modules.conf to modprobe.conf:

        ./generate-modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.conf

4) If you are using devfs, copy modprobe.devfs to /etc

5) You will need to run "depmod" for your new kernel, eg:

        depmod 2.5.50
