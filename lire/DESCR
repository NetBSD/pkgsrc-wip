As any good system administrator knows, there's a lot more to keep
track of in an active network than just webservers. Lire is hands
down the most versatile log analysis software available today. Lire
not only keeps you informed about your HTTP, FTP, and mail traffic,
it also reports on your firewalls, your print servers, and your
DNS activity. The ever growing list of Lire-supported services
clearly outstrips any other software, in large part thanks to the
numerous volunteers who have pioneered many new services and
features. Lire is a total solution for your log analysis needs.
