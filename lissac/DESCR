Making a new operating system drive us to conceive a new programmation language
Lisaac.This language based on prototype object is strongly inspired from self
language.More than the advantages of self, Lisaac give protection of
comunication mecanism and operating system tools.

Using prototype and dynamic inheritance is fully adapted to the conception
of operating system. First tests learn us, that Lisaac compiler is able to
give the same performance than C compiler. Lisaac inherit of Self's semantic
and of the Eiffel's static typing.
