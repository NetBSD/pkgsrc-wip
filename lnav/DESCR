An advanced log file viewer for the small-scale.  Watch and analyze
your log files from a terminal.

Many logging tools, like Splunk, provide great features but are
optimized for large-scale deployments.  They require installing
and configuring servers before they can be effectively used.  There
is still a need for a robust log file analyzer for the terminal.

Just point lnav to a directory and it will take care of the rest.
File formats are automatically detected and compressed files are
unpacked on the fly.

Log files are a wealth of information, lnav can help highlight the
parts that are important and filter out the noise.
