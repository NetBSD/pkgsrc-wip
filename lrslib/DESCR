A convex polyhedron is the set of points satisfying a finite family of linear
inequalities.The study of the vertices and extreme rays of such systems is
important and useful in e.g. mathematics and optimization. In a dual
interpretation, finding the vertices of a (bounded) polyhedron is equivalent to
finding the convex hull (bounding inequalities) of an (arbitrary dimensional)
set of points. Lrs (lexicographic reverse search) has two important features
that can be very important for certain applications: it works in exact
arithmetic, and it consumes memory proportional to the input, no matter how
large the output is.
