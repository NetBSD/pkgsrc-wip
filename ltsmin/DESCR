LTSmin started out as a generic toolset for manipulating labelled transition
systems. Meanwhile the toolset was extended to a a full (LTL/CTL/mu-calculus)
model checker, while maintaining its language-independent characteristics.

To obtain its input, LTSmin connects a sizeable number of existing
(verification) tools: *muCRL*, *mCRL2*, *DiVinE*, *SPIN* (*SpinS*), *UPPAAL*
(*opaal*), *SCOOP*, *PNML*, *ProB* and *CADP*. Moreover, it allows to reuse
existing tools with new state space generation techniques by exporting LTSs
into various formats.
