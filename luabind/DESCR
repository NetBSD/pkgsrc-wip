Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua. It
has the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to Lua. It
will also supply the functionality to define classes in Lua and let them
derive from other Lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override
virtual functions from their C++ baseclasses.
