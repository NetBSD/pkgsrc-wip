This is a NetBSD compressor kernel module for PPP compatible with the
Stac LZS scheme as described in rfc1974.

This compressor actually only handles decompression, outgoing packets
will be sent uncompressed. The native NetBSD cannot negotiate LZS so
make sure you use PPP daemon from pkgsrc/net/pppd.
