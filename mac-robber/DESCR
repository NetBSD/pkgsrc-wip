mac-robber is a Forensics & Incident Response tool used to collect
the Modified, Access, and Change (MAC) times from allocated files.
It recursively reads MAC times of files and directories and prints
them in 'time machine' format to STDOUT.  This format is the same
that the mactime tool from The Sleuth Kit[1] and The Coroners Toolkit
(TCT)[2] read.
