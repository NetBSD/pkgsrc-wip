Now another package with-editor is necessary (magit/with-editor at github)

In toplevel form:
git-commit.el:109:2: Error: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, with-editor
gmake[1]: *** [Makefile:70: git-commit.elc] Error 1
gmake[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/wip/magit-git/work/magit-4.1.3/lisp'
gmake: *** [Makefile:74: lisp] Error 2
*** Error code 2
