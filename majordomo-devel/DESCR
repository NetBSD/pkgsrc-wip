Majordomo is a program which automates the management of Internet
mailing lists.  Commands are sent to Majordomo via electronic mail to
handle all aspects of list maintainance.  Once a list is set up,
virtually all operations can be performed remotely, requiring no
intervention upon the postmaster of the list site.

     charge for another. From latin "major domus" - "master of the
     house".
