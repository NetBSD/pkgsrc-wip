- Feel free to work on this. I (Klaus Heinz) only started this packages
  because others need it and I cannot devote too much time to it.
  
- Installation is rather oldfashioned (see README.DIRECTORIES): everything
  wants to live under some central directory. IMO, it would be better
  to separate the Perl module(s) and handle them like every other CPAN
  module. The rest would be packaged separately and should depend on the
  Perl module(s). Maybe a better directory layout is possible even now.

- Tests t/core.t and t/shell.t complain when MJ2_MTA=qmail because the
  "mta_separator" is required in the configuration file .mj_config.
  This should be fixed upstream (see setup/mta_qmail.pl. Doesn't qmail
  usually use '-' instead of '+'?).

- How do we handle the 4 MTAs? 4 separate packages? 4 options, the default
  "postfix" for NetBSD?
  For now MJ2_MTA has to be set in the Makefile.

- How can we add domains with binary packages? The documentation suggests

    Run "make domain" in the top-level source directory

  which is not really a satisfying solution :-/

- How do we handle interactive setting of the master password?

- pkglint comlains about perllocal.pod in PLIST.*. Would be no problem if
  majordomo would install as real Perl package.
