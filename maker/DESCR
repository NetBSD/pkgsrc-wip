MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation
pipeline. Its purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic
genome projects to independently annotate their genomes and to create
genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins
to a genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically
synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based
quality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary
runs can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction
algorithm, producing higher quality gene-models on seusequent
runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded
into a GMOD database. They can also be viewed in the Apollo genome
browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate,
view and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a
database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model
organism projects with minimal bioinformatics expertise and computer
resources.
