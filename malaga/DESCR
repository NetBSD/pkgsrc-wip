This is Malaga, a software package for the development and application
of grammars that are used for the analysis of words and sentences
of natural languages. It is a language-independent system that
offers a programming language for the modelling of the language-dependent
grammatical information. This language is also called Malaga.

Malaga is based on the grammatical theory of the "Left Associative
Grammar" (LAG), developed by Roland Hausser, professor for
Computational Linguistics at University of Erlangen, Germany.
