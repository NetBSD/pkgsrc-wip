Are you ready for the first MAME release of 2026? MAME 0.285 is
out now! We’ve added support for an early, unreleased version of
Atari’s Relief Pitcher running on their System 1 platform. Moon
Raker, a Nichibutsu shooter from the late ’70s, has also been found
and emulated. Sega’s Waku Waku series has been further filled out
with the addition of Waku Waku Jumbo. And for something completely
different, Apple’s first computer built around the WIMP paradigm,
the Lisa, is starting the year in substantially better shape.

If you play arcade games that utilised lightguns, you’ll no doubt
be aware that pulling the trigger while aiming the gun away from
the screen was a common way to reload. You may also be aware that
MAME had an option to make this a bit easier if you’re using a
lightgun to play. That option has been removed, with a new plugin
taking its place. The great news is that the plugin works even if
you aren’t using a lightgun. That’s right, you can now assign a
button to reload when you’re playing Virtua Cop or Lethal Enforcers
with a keyboard, mouse or trackball. Check the plugin documentation
for more details.

The Hanimex Pencil II computer has had a bit of an overhaul, which
should make more software usable. A few more of the many BBC Micro
peripherals have been emulated. Other improvements this month
include better Apple IIgs periodic interrupt emulation, another
working Apple II clone from behind the Iron Curtain, better
representation of base Grid Compass hardware configurations, and
better default sound routing for people using Apple notebook
computers.
