MAME 0.279 is here at last! Building on the work in recent releases,
this month you’ll get to see proper lighting and fixes for logic
bugs in Sega Model 2 games. Philips CD-i emulation keeps improving
as well, including better cursor behaviour and XA audio fixes this
month. While we’re talking about things you can see, MAME now
emulates the “snow” effect on early ZX Spectrum models caused by
memory refresh cycles interfering with video RAM accesses. Graphical
issues in various Konami and Irem games have been fixed, and there
are noticeable improvements to graphics in some Namco System 23
games.

There’s been more work this month on support for NES-inspired chips
from V.R. Technology, bringing some of these low-cost games closer
to working. There are lots of improvements for emulated Macs,
particularly the PowerBook Duo sub-notebooks, and fixes for a few
issues with the Apple IIgs as well. The Casio FZ-1 and related
sampling synthesisers now have preliminary sound output. The Sharp
MZ-5500 computers are also starting to show some life, although
emulation is far from complete.
