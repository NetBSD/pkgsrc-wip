This is the version of man written by John Eaton and maintained by

This man package provides a man pager that supports compressed
pages, locales and message catalogs. It also includes makewhatis
for creating the whatis database, apropos and whatis for searching
the whatis database, man2dvi for formating manpages to DVI, and
man2html for converting manpages to HTML.

This package does not include the CGI scripts nor hman utility
for web-based manpage viewing.
