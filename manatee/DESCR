Manatee is a web-based gene evaluation and genome annotation tool. 
Manatee can store and view annotation for prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
genomes. The Manatee interface allows biologists to quickly identify 
genes and make high quality functional assignments, such as GO 
classifications, using search data, paralogous families, and 
annotation suggestions generated from automated analysis.
Manatee is written in Perl and run under the CGI area of a web server, 
such as Apache. Manatee also requires at least one Mysql (or Sybase) 
project database and associated search files. The project databases 
use a data model and schema developed at TIGR for representing 
Eukaryotic or Prokaryotic data.
