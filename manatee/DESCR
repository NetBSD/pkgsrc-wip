Manatee is a web-based gene evaluation and genome annotation tool.
Manatee can store and view annotation for prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genomes. The Manatee interface allows biologists to quickly identify
genes and make high quality functional assignments, such as GO
classifications, using search data, paralogous families, and
annotation suggestions generated from automated analysis.
Manatee is written in Perl and run under the CGI area of a web server,
such as Apache. Manatee also requires at least one Mysql (or Sybase)
project database and associated search files. The project databases
use a data model and schema developed at TIGR for representing
Eukaryotic or Prokaryotic data.
