The Pfhor have taken their battle into the depths of time, and you must
follow.

Admist the legends of both the Pfhor and S'pht are tales of time travels, and
beings that have granted secrets to other races. And one of those secrets has
apparently landed in the hands of Leonardo Da Vinci.

You and the S'pht must travel back in time to prevent those secrets from
falling into the hands of the Pfhor, before they can use them to cause a time
paradox that will rip the universe apart.
