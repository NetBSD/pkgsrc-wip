The following is an excerpt from a three-way email discussion that took 
place on 2012/2/20 and 21.

Chris Borowiec:
James and Tim,
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the 2.0 version doesn't allow adaptive  
works, while 3.0 does.

We encourage adaptive works, provided they have our permission to do  
so. It appears (to me) that 3.0 says "do whatever you want with it",  
and I don't really like the sound of that.

Please let me know if I'm missing something. Tempus Irae can be freely  
distributed, but if you're going to muck with it (aside from creating  
some levels with what's already there), we would like to be asked if  
it's OK first.

Thanks,
Chris B.

Tim Larson:
I think you're speaking more of the difference between the BY-NC-ND 
(No Derivatives) flavor and the BY-NC-SA (Share Alike) flavor of the
CCPL.  It sounds like ND speaks better to your intent than SA does.   
If you explicity give permission, that overrides the license terms, of 
course, so that situation is covered too.

Tim,
2.5 seems to work for me. Any input James?

Thanks,

James Hastings-Trew:
Yep, sounds good to me. Decision made. NEXT!
