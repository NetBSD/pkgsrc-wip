Mashpodder allows the user to download podcast episodes.
The user can choose to save these episodes in a named directory
or in a date-based directory, so the most recent episodes are in one folder.
Or, the user can combine this by having some podcasts in a named directory
and others in the date-based directory.
The user can choose to download all, none, or a set number of episodes per feed.
The user can also choose to mark the episodes as downloaded
which can be used to 'catch up' to a podcast.
