This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the entire
Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per
second.

It produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner.
Internally, it operates more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap,
using asynchronous transmission. The major difference is that it's
faster than these other scanners. In addition, it's more flexible,
allowing arbitrary address ranges and port ranges.

NOTE: masscan uses a custom TCP/IP stack. Anything other than simple
port scans will cause conflict with the local TCP/IP stack. This
means you need to either use the -S option to use a separate IP
address, or configure your operating system to firewall the ports
that masscan uses.
