MCatS is a Modular Catalog System. The basic idea is to have several
modules (shared libraries) that can be dynamically loaded on demand.

For example, if you want to scan a CD-ROM and store it in a database,
you just specify that you want to read from CD and output to database.
Its flexibility makes it very easy to convert between different formats,
like between "WhereIsIt?" and csv format.

This package includes support for: cdinput, stdout and wii. Additional
iodbc support can be obtained by installing mcats-iodbc package.
