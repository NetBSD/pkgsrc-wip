mccs (which stands for Multi Criteria CUDF Solver) provides a mean
to solve cudf problems as defined in the MANCOOSI european project
(http://www.mancoosi.org) and was partially supported by the European
Community's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), MANCOOSI
project, grant agreement n. 214898.

mccs has been developed under linux and has not been tested on
other platforms.  The provided mccs is statically linked and run
under linux 32 bits.

mccs translate the cudf problem into an integer linear program
which is then solved by an underlying solver.
