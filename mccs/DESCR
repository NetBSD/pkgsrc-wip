mccs (which stands for Multi Criteria CUDF Solver) provides a mean to
solve cudf problems as defined in the MANCOOSI european project
(http://www.mancoosi.org) and was partially supported by the European
Community's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), MANCOOSI project,
grant agreement n. 214898.

mccs has been developed under linux and has not been tested on other
platforms.  The provided mccs is statically linked and run under linux
32 bits.

mccs translate the cudf problem into an integer linear program which
is then solved by an underlying solver.
