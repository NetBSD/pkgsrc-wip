The MDB Tools project is a effort to document the MDB file format used in
Microsoft's Access database package, and to provide a set of tools and
applications to make that data available on other platforms.

Specifically, MDB Tools includes programs to export schema and data to other
databases such as MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, PostgreSQL, and others.
