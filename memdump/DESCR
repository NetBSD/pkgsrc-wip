What can you expect to find in a system memory dump? Bits from the
operating system, from running processes, and from every file and
directory that has been accessed recently. Depending on the operating
system you may even find some information from deleted files and
exited processes, although that information tends to be short-lived.

To dump physical memory:

    memdump | nc host port
    memdump | openssl s_client -connect host:port

For best results send output off-host over the network. Writing to
file risks clobbering all the memory in the file system cache. Use
netcat, stunnel, or openssl, depending on your requirements.

With the exception of Linux, dumping UNIX system memory is a tricky
business because /dev/mem has holes that one has to carefully skip
around in order not to read nonsense or even miss information.
