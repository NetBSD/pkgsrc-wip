The program mendex is a general purpose hierqarchical index generator;
it accepts one or more input files (.idx; often produced by a text
formatter such as LaTeX), sorts the entries, and produces an output
file which can be formatted. It is almost compatible with makeindex,
and additional feature for handling readings of kanji words is also
available.
