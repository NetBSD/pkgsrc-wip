Nyacc, for Not Yet Another Compiler Compiler, is a set of guile
modules for generating computer language parsers and lexical
analyzers. It is an LALR(1) parser generator implemented in
Guile.

It includes a decent C99 parser that outputs SXML trees.

It includes an application, called the FFI Helper, for automatic
generation of Scheme FFI code for C libraries, much like SWIG.
