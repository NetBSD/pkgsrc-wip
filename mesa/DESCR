The Mesa project began as an open-source implementation of the OpenGL
specification - a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics.

Over the years the project has grown to implement more graphics APIs,
including OpenGL ES (versions 1, 2, 3), OpenCL, OpenMAX, VDPAU, VA API,
XvMC and Vulkan.

A variety of device drivers allows the Mesa libraries to be used in many
different environments ranging from software emulation to complete hardware
acceleration for modern GPUs.
