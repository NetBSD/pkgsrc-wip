Tracker is a tool designed to extract information and metadata
about your personal data so that it can be searched easily and
quickly.

By using Tracker, you no longer have to remember where you've left
your files. To locate a file you only need to remember something
about it, such as a word in the document or the artist of the song.
This is because as well as searching for files in the traditional
way, by name and location, Tracker searches files' contents and
metadata.
