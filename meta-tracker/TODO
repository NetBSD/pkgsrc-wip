Somehow convince this to use pkgsrc sqlite3
sqlite3 to build threadsafe

Currently fails at:
	checking for sqlite3.h... yes
	checking for sqlite3_threadsafe in -lsqlite3... yes
	checking whether sqlite was compiled thread-safe... no
	configure: error: sqlite3 is not compiled thread-safe
	*** Error code 1

- GNOME3: re-enable options once the relevant packages
  have been updated.

- PLIST variation by options are not fully checked yet.
- Combination of options may have some constraint, but not
  checked, for example,
  gstreamer and playlist may not be set at the same time ?

  PLIST.mplayer
  PLIST.totem
  are flagged by pkglint. Need check the logic also
