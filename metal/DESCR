METAL is a tool for meta-analysis genomewide association scans. METAL can
combine either (a) test statistics and standard errors or (b) p-values across
studies (taking sample size and direction of effect into account). METAL
analysis is a convenient alternative to a direct analysis of merged data from
multiple studies. It is especially appropriate when data from the individual
studies cannot be analyzed together because of differences in ethnicity,
phenotype distribution, gender or constraints in sharing of individual level
data imposed. Meta-analysis results in little or no loss of efficiency compared
to analysis of a combined dataset including data from all individual studies.
