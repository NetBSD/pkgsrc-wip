lsh is a shell which resembles command interpreters of PC
systems (such as 4-DOS, DR-DOS, FREE-DOS, MS-DOS, OPEN-DOS, N-DOS,
PC-DOS, Q-DOS and others, which might be trademarks of their owners
and which is hereby acknowledged).

Many of these command interpreters are but poor copies of proper
unix shells. So you can think of lsh as a poor clone of a poor
clone.
