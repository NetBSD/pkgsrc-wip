MiKTeX is both a modern C/C++ implementation of TeX & Friends and a
TeX distribution.

- MiKTeX is a scalable TeX distribution (["Just enough
  TeX"](https://miktex.org/kb/just-enough-tex)):
  * you can start with MiKTeX executables and man pages
  * in the course of authoring your documents: only necessary packages
    will be downloaded and installed

The MiKTeX source code is documented here:
