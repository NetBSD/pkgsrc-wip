Minimap2 is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns DNA or
mRNA sequences against a large reference database. Typical use cases
include: (1) mapping PacBio or Oxford Nanopore genomic reads to the
human genome; (2) finding overlaps between long reads with error rate
up to ~15%; (3) splice-aware alignment of PacBio Iso-Seq or Nanopore
cDNA or Direct RNA reads against a reference genome; (4) aligning
Illumina single- or paired-end reads; (5) assembly-to-assembly
alignment; (6) full-genome alignment between two closely related
species with divergence below ~15%.

For ~10kb noisy reads sequences, minimap2 is tens of times faster than
mainstream long-read mappers such as BLASR, BWA-MEM, NGMLR and
GMAP. It is more accurate on simulated long reads and produces
biologically meaningful alignment ready for downstream analyses. For
>100bp Illumina short reads, minimap2 is three times as fast as
BWA-MEM and Bowtie2, and as accurate on simulated data.  Detailed
evaluations are available from the minimap2 paper
(https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191).
