This program consists of

* a remailer client:

  The remailer client supports sending anonymous mail using Cypherpunk
  and Mixmaster remailers, managing pseudonyms at Newnym nym servers
  and receiving mail anonymously from Cypherpunk remailers. It supports
  OpenPGP encryption (compatible with PGP 2, PGP 5 and up, and GnuPG).

  The client can be used with a menu-based user interface and with
  command line options.

* a remailer:

  The remailer supports the Cypherpunk and Mixmaster message formats.
  It can be integrated with the mail delivery system of Unix-based
  computers or use the POP3 and SMTP protocols for mail transfer.
  Mixmaster includes an automated abuse-handling system.

[XXX WIP NOTE:  Server functionality in this package is not yet complete.]
