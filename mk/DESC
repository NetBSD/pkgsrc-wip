Please provide .mk files descriptions and reasons for existence of those
files here.

linuxbin.pkg.mk	- generalised .mk file for installing Linux binary packages,
		  for various architectures, no matter - deb or rpm.
		  Introduced by Michal Pasternak <dotz@irc.pl>
		  
		  Why:
		  - pkgsrc contains many packages, that use RPM files
		  - current emul/suse_linux/ layer provided by Makefile.common
		    is no good (can't override path for RPMFILES, for example)
		  - could be used by emul/linux base packages as well
