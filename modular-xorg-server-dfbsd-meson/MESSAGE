For the X server to run you need at least some fonts installed. The
recommended approach is to install the entire modular-xorg-fonts
meta-package, but failing that the minimum set required is:

	fonts/font-alias
	fonts/font-misc-misc
	fonts/font-cursor-misc

This package does *not* depend on these font packages directly as
in some circumstances installing extra copies from pkgsrc would be
redundant or possibly harmful.
