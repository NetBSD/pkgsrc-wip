To use the 1.4 series server with current pkgsrc, you must perform some
changes in pkgsrc first:

o Add this line to x11/modular-xorg-server/buildlink3.mk:

.include "../../x11/pixman/buildlink3.mk"

o You should now be able to build wip/modular-xorg-server14,
  x11/xf86-input-keyboard, x11/xf86-input-mouse and x11/xf86-video-*

o The sources this server is built from have about ~20 patches applied
  at any given time.  I manage this insanity with StGIT, which I highly
  recommend (better than quilt).  If you'd like the patch series, 
  drop me a line.
