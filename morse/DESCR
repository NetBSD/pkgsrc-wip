A morse-code training program and QSO generator.

Morse Classic is a Morse-code training program for aspiring radio hams.
It can generate random tests or simulated QSOs resembling those used in
the ARRL test (a QSO generator is included). There are a plethora of
options to vary the training method.

In one of the simpler modes, this program will take text from standard
input and render it as Morse-code beeps.
