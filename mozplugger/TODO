define a MOZILLA_PLUGINS definition like ${PREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins

in MESSAGE list packages that could be installed as a suggestion

for firefox-gtk2 to use, I create symlink for a new
lib/firefox-gtk2/plugins directory to lib/mozilla/plugins
maybe that should be in a MESSAGE?

need to test (firefox showed the plugin, but not needed since gxine was used)
