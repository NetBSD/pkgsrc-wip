mp3chop can be used for extracting parts of MP3 files and reporting
information about MP3 files. It is designed to work as a filter program
in the UNIX sense. As it processes the file it only outputs MP3 frames
so it also removes junk from the file. It is capable of stripping or
preserving ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. Since it only works at the frame level
it supports layer 1 and layer 2 files in addition to the layer 3 files
implied by its name.
