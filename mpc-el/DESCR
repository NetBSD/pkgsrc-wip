This is an Emacs front end to the Music Player Daemon.

MPC.el mostly provides a browser inspired from Rhythmbox for your
music collection and also allows you to play the music you select. The
basic interface is somewhat unusual for mpd in that it does not
provide direct access to MusicPD's playlist functionality. Instead it
uses MusicPD's playlist internally to implement a queue of songs. This
means that it does not always interact nicely with other clients that
you may be using at the same time.

The author plays albums rather than songs and thus don't have much
need for playlists, and it shows. Playlist support exists, but is
embryonic. The intention is to handle playlists just like any other
attributes. I.e. placing a file in playlist FooSongs is treated as
equivalent to adding a tag "playlist=FooSongs".

The package is in the early stage of development. If you're not
interested in fiddling with the code, it's probably too early for you
to try it out. But if you do try it out, please tell the author know
how it goes.
