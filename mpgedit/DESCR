mpgedit is an MPEG 1 layer 1/2/3 (mp3), MPEG 2, and MPEG 2.5 audio
file editor that is capable of processing both Constant Bit Rate
(CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoded files. mpgedit can cut
an input MPEG file into one or more output files, as well as join
one or more input MPEG files into a single output file. Since no
file decoding / encoding occurs during editing, there is no audio
quality loss when editing with mpgedit. When editing VBR files that
have a XING header, mpgedit updates the output file's XING header
information to reflect the new file size and average bit rate.

mpgedit operates in two modes: a command line and a curses-based,
full-screen interactive shell. All editing functionality is available
in both modes. The chief advantage of the interactive mode comes
when using the playback feature for selection and verification of
edit begin and end times, which is more rapidly performed interactively.

xmpgedit, a GTK2-based GUI for mpgedit, is also included.
