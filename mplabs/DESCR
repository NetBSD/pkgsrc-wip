MP-LABS is a suite of numerical simulation tools for multiphase flows based on
the free energy Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The code allows for the
simulation of quasi-incompressible two-phase flows, and uses multiphase models
that allow for large density ratios. MP-LABS provides implementations that use
periodic boundary conditions, but it is written in a way that allows for can be
analyzed using other Open Source tools such as Gnuplot and Paraview.
