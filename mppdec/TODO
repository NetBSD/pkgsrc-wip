I expect this not to build anywhere except my FreeBSD box. The code has a
lot of portability defines anyway, so please help with patching it.

Linux makefile uses -lesd unconditionally.

Perhaps make USE_ESD_AUDIO configureable, currently it is turned off by
default.

HTTP support disabled unconditionally, doesn't compile on FreeBSD.

nasm support would be definetley *worth* doing, currently disabled (nasm is
not used in Makefile.nol; it is used in Makefile, but on the other hand,
that Makefile has some other trouble). I am leaving out nasm for the sake of
portability... and I need that decoder just to recode some MPC files to OGG
or MP3, so why should I bother ;)

do-install could perhaps install some extra files (is there a manpage in
WRKSRC?)

Basically, mppdec should use some other makefile (or some kind of configure
script) to be more portable. Please help developing it, if you have skills
to do such thing, e-mail author or at least MAINTAINER of this package with
some code.

Sounds and decodes lousy on my host. Are MPCs that incompatible, or is it
somehow borked? Could anyone make some patches?

And, finally, package mppenc (MPC encoder) from the same author/site.
