Mutabah's Rust Compiler

  _In-progress_ alternative rust compiler. Capable of building a
  fully-working copy of rustc, but not suitable for everyday use
  (due to terrible error messages).

This project is a "simple" rust compiler written in C++ that is
able to bootstrap a "recent" rustc, but may eventually become a
full separate re-implementation.

`mrustc`'s primary goal is bootstrapping `rustc`, and as such it
tends to assume that the code it's compiling is valid (and any
errors in the generated code are mrustc bugs). Code generation is
done by emitting a high-level assembly (currently very ugly C, but
LLVM/cretone/GIMPLE/... could work) and getting an external tool
(i.e. `gcc`) to do the heavy-lifting of optimising and machine code
generation.

=====

This is the mrust LLVM package.  It builds some LLVM components
from the LLVM sources included in the rust-lang.org distribution.
Building mrust-rustc depends, in turn, on these components.
