===> Installing for tcl-8.4.6nb5
===> tcl-8.3.4 is already installed - perhaps an older version?
*** If so, you may use either of:
***  - "pkg_delete tcl-8.3.4" and "/usr/bin/make reinstall" to upgrade properly
***  - "/usr/bin/make update" to rebuild the package and all of its dependencies
***  - "/usr/bin/make replace" to replace only the package without re-linking
***    dependencies, risking various problems.
*** Error code 1

Stop.
