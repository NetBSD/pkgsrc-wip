mtm is the Micro Terminal Multiplexer, a terminal multiplexer.
It has four major features/principles: simplicity,
compatibility, size, and stability.

There are only a few commands, two of which are hardly ever used.
There are no modes, no dozens of commands, no crazy feature list.
mtm emulates a classic ANSI text terminal. That means it should
work out of the box on essentially all terminfo/termcap-based
systems (even pretty old ones), without needing to install a new
termcap entry. mtm is small; the entire project is around 1000
lines of code. mtm is "finished" as it is now.You don't need to
worry about it changing on you unexpectedly.
