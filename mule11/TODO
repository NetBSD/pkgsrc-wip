(1) Only tried with NetBSD/amd64, just starting. (Thanks @tsutsuii)
   - Test is only done by FreeWnn, but not successfull even with it 
     (you need to start jserver before you start mule)

   (Now tested also on NetBSD/i386)

(2) src/xemacs is not handled yet

(3) in some case you will see
modena@makoto 13:51:14/150407(..wip/mule11)% mule
Fatal error (6).zsh: abort (core dumped)  mule

My case was I had following line in .Xdefaults
 Emacs.Font:     -*-*-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-14
This is harmfull for current mule-1.1
