muon is an implementation of the meson build system in c99 with minimal
dependencies.

Non-features
============
- bug-for-bug compatibility with meson.
  In fact, muon aspires to be stricter than meson in cases where meson's
  implementation seems error prone. muon uses the official meson
  documentation as its specification.
- cli compatibility with meson.
  muon has different flags, subcommands, etc., and should not be
  renamed/symlinked to meson.
