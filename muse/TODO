This package has serious problems with threads (at least on -current system as
of Wed May 14 10:40:45 CEST 2003).  It doesn't start unless PTHREAD_ERRORMODE
is set to "print" (_lots_ of output) or "ignore", then it's unable to play
MP3 files (Ogg Vorbis is fine, tested 4 channels simultaneously).  i've not
tested streaming.
