 myFitter is a C++ class library for maximum likelihood fits and the numerical
computation of p-values in likelihood ratio tests.

In some situations the statistical significance (p-value) of a likelihood ratio
test can not be computed analytically. This is, for example, the case when some
parameters of the model are only allowed to float within a certain range or when
the models being compared are not nested, meaning that neither model can be
obtained from the other by fixing some of its parameters.

myFitter implements a method for efficient numerical computation of p-values.
This method is also applicable in the case of non-nested models
