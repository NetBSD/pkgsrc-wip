TODO file for nagios-plugin-snmp:
     check_snmp tested and works
     check_hpjd tested and works+ (cool!)
     check_ifoperstatus tested and works
     check_ifstatus: works but net-snmp thinks lo0 is
		     ifAdminStatus.4 = INTEGER: up(1)
		     ifOperStatus.4 = INTEGER: down(2)
     ruh?? use -u option to skip lo0
