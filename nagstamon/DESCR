Nagstamon is a Nagios status monitor for the desktop inspired by Nagios Checker
for Firefox.
It connects to multiple Nagios servers and resides in systray or as a floating
statusbar at the desktop showing a brief summary of critical, warning, unknown,
unreachable and down hosts and services and pops up a detailed status overview
when moving the mouse pointer over it. Connecting to displayed hosts and
services is easily established by context menu via SSH, RDP and VNC. Users can
be notified by sound. Hosts and Services can be filtered by category and
regular expressions.
