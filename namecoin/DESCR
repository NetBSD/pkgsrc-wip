Namecoin is a decentralized open source information registration and transfer
system based on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Namecoin can:

 * Securely record and transfer arbitrary names (keys).
 * Attach a value (data) to the names (up to 520 bytes, more in the future).
 * Transact namecoins, the digital currency (NMC).

Namecoin was the first fork of Bitcoin and still is one of the most innovative
altcoins. It was first to implement merged mining and a decentralized DNS.
