Quality control tools for long read sequencing data aiming to
replicate some of the plots made by fastQC. This is an immature tool
and I welcome all contributions.

Creates dynamic plots using bokeh.  For an example see
http://decoster.xyz/wouter/.

nanoQC [-h] [-v] [-o OUTDIR] fastq

positional arguments:
  fastq                 Reads data in fastq.gz format.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Print version and exit.
  -o, --outdir OUTDIR   Specify directory in which output has to be created.
  -l, --minlen int      Minimum length of reads to be included in the plots
                        This also controls the length plotted in the graphs
                        from the beginning and end of reads
			(length plotted = minlen / 2)
