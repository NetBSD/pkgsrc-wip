Compare multiple runs of long read sequencing data and
alignments. Creates violin plots or box plots of length, quality and
percent identity and creates dynamic, overlaying read length
histograms and a cumulative yield plot.

As of version 1.1.0 NanoComp will also create a static png image for
dynamic html plots, as the latter can get quite big and slow to load
for big datasets. This however requires that you install orca
(https://github.com/plotly/orca). Without orca the script still works,
but no static copies of dynamic plots are created.

I welcome all suggestions, bug reports, feature requests and
contributions. Please leave an issue

request.
