Filter and trim of long read sequencing data.

Filtering on quality and/or read length, and optional trimming after
passing filters.  Reads from stdin, writes to stdout.  Optionally
reads directly from an uncompressed file specified on the command
line.  Intended uses:

- directly after fastq extraction
- prior to mapping
- in a stream between extraction and mapping

Due to a discrepancy between calculated read quality and the quality
as summarized by albacore this script takes since v1.1.0 optionally
also a `--summary` argument. Using this argument with the
sequencing_summary.txt file from albacore will do the filtering using
the quality scores from the summary. It's also faster.

### Examples

gunzip -c reads.fastq.gz | NanoFilt -q 10 -l 500 --headcrop 50 \
       | minimap2 genome.fa - | samtools sort -O BAM -@24 -o alignment.bam -
gunzip -c reads.fastq.gz | NanoFilt -q 12 --headcrop 75 \
       | gzip > trimmed-reads.fastq.gz
gunzip -c reads.fastq.gz | NanoFilt -q 10 | gzip > highQuality-reads.fastq.gz
