This module provides a few simple math and statistics functions for
other scripts processing Oxford Nanopore sequencing data

## Functions

* Calculate read N50 from a set of lengths `get_N50(readlenghts)`

* Remove extreme length outliers from a dataset
  `remove_length_outliers(dataframe, columname)`

* Calculate the average Phred quality of a read `ave_qual(qualscores)`

* Write out the statistics report after calling readstats function
  `write_stats(dataframe, outputname)`

* Compute a number of statistics, return a dictionary
  `calc_read_stats(dataframe)`
