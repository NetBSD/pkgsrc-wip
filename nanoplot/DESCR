Plotting tool for long read sequencing data and alignments.

This script performs data extraction from Oxford Nanopore sequencing
data in the following formats:

- fastq files (can be bgzip, bzip2 or gzip compressed)

- fastq files generated by albacore, guppy or MinKNOW containing
  additional information (can be bgzip, bzip2 or gzip compressed)

- sorted bam files

- sequencing_summary.txt output table generated by albacore, guppy or
  MinKnow basecalling (can be gzip, bz2, zip and xz compressed)

- fasta files (can be bgzip, bzip2 or gzip compressed)

Multiple files of the same type can be offered simultaneously

NanoPlot creates:
- a statistical summary
- a number of plots
- a html summary file
