A small C library with that portably invokes native file open,
folder select and file save dialogs.  Write dialog code once and
have itpop up native dialogs on all supported platforms.  Avoid
linking large dependencies like wxWidgets and Qt.

- Lean C API, static library &mdash; no C++/ObjC runtime needed
- Supports Windows (MSVC, MinGW, Clang), macOS (Clang), and Linux
  (GTK, portal) (GCC, Clang)
- Zlib licensed
- Friendly names for filters (e.g. `C/C++ Source files (*.c;*.cpp)`
  instead of `(*.c;*.cpp)`) on platforms that support it
- Automatically append file extension on platforms where users
  expect it
- Support for setting a default folder path
- Support for setting a default file name (e.g. `Untitled.c`)
- Consistent UTF-8 support on all platforms
- Native character set (UTF-16 `wchar_t`) support on Windows
