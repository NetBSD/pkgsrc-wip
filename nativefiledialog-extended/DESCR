# Native File Dialog Extended

![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended/workflows/build/badge.svg)

A small C library with that portably invokes native file open, folder select and file save dialogs.  Write dialog code once and have it pop up native dialogs on all supported platforms.  Avoid linking large dependencies like wxWidgets and Qt.

This library is based on Michael Labbe's Native File Dialog ([mlabbe/nativefiledialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog)).

Features:

- Lean C API, static library &mdash; no C++/ObjC runtime needed
- Supports Windows (MSVC, MinGW, Clang), macOS (Clang), and Linux (GTK, portal) (GCC, Clang)
- Zlib licensed
- Friendly names for filters (e.g. `C/C++ Source files (*.c;*.cpp)` instead of `(*.c;*.cpp)`) on platforms that support it
- Automatically append file extension on platforms where users expect it
- Support for setting a default folder path
- Support for setting a default file name (e.g. `Untitled.c`)
- Consistent UTF-8 support on all platforms
- Native character set (UTF-16 `wchar_t`) support on Windows
