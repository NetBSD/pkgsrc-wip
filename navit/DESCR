Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine.

Navit's modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats
for routing and rendering on the screen. It's even possible to use multiple
maps at the same time.

The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen
displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map.

The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA
GPS sensors.

The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination,
but also generates directions and even speaks to you using espeak.

Navit currently speaks 49 languages, can run on various platforms (Linux,
Windows, Android, OpenMoko Freerunner, Wince, Nokia n800 Internet tables,
iPhone, Zaurus..)
