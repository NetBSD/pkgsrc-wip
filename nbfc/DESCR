The brainfuck language is an esoteric programming language noted for its
extreme minimalism. It was designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and
is not suitable for practical use.

Its author is Urban Mueller from Switzerland, who also wrote the original
interpreter for brainfuck and a compiler for the Amiga.

nbfc is the "new brainfuck compiler": A brainfuck-to-C and brainfuck-to-
Java-compiler.
