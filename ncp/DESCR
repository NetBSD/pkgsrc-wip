npush will now use IPv6 and IPv4 multicast on the multicast groups
ff02::6e63:7030 (6e63:7030 == 'ncp0') and 224.110.99.112 (110.99.112
== 'ncp'). If both methods fail, npush will resort to the broadcast
packets used by previous versions. You can force the broadcast
method by passing "-b" to npush so that previous npoll versions
can see the announcements.

"ncp" is a utility for copying files in a LAN. It has absolutely
no security or integrity checking, no throttling, no features,
except one: you don't have to type the coordinates of your peer.
