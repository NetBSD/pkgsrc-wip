Neatroff is a new implementation of the Troff typesetting system written
in C.  It tries to address, as neatly as possible, some of the
shortcomings of the original Troff based on the ideas and features
available in Plan 9 Troff, Heirloom Troff, and Groff.

The Neatmkfn program creates Neatroff font description files from AFM
(Adobe Font Metrics), TrueType, and OpenType fonts.
