Neatroff is a new implementation of the Troff typesetting system written
in C.  It tries to address, as neatly as possible, some of the
shortcomings of the original Troff based on the ideas and features
available in Plan 9 Troff, Heirloom Troff, and Groff.

This package contains the Neatroff font description for the awesome 6
font.
