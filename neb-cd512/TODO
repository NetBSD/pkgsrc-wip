- Perhaps some testing - although I did on alpha and i386 so it should run on any NetBSD platform
- Will work and is configured to be NetBSD only due to calls of opendisk(3) and some disklabel-related IOCTLs which are not available on all OS (maybe someone should try on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, ...)
- Ready for uploading into pkgsrc beside upper items
