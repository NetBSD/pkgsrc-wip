neb-hdtoolbox is a tool that can bootstrap a new disk for NetBSD/amiga
without need of Amiga OS' "hdtoolbox" program.
It can cross-partition any disk from ANY NetBSD platform.
neb-hdtoolbox can also add, remove or resize existing NetBSD/amiga
partitions, either from a running NetBSD/amiga or as a cross tool
from any NetBSD platform.
