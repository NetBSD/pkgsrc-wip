Neon Modem Overdrive is a BBS-style command line client that supports Discourse,
Lemmy, Lobsters and Hacker News as backends, and seamlessly integrates all of
them into a streamlined TUI. And yes, you heard that right, I really did call
it Neon Modem Overdrive.

Neon Modem is built in Go, using Charm's Bubble Tea TUI framework, but
implements an own window manager (or compositor if you want) that allows it to
use a third dimension, on top of the two dimensional rendering that Bubble Tea
offers today. With that it is possible to display dialogs on top of one another,
in order to offer a smoother UI experience.
