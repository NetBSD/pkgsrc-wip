NEStopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator
written in C++ by Martin Freij and ported to Linux by R. Belmont.
NEStopia strives for the most accurate emulation possible at the
pixel-by-pixel and sample-by-sample level, and it has excellent
mapper and UNIF board support as well. A few features:

- Supports .nes and .unf/.unif format ROMs
- Supports .fds discs
- Supports .nsf music rips
- All supported files can be extracted from zip or 7zip containers (an
  archive browser is not yet included - this assumes the common
  GoodSet case of one zip or 7zip per game)
- Autodetection of PAL and NTSC format games

This version is based on nestopia-1.40hnb19 and is optimized for Raspberry
Pis running NetBSD.

It only depends on SDL with a plain text settings file.  Extra options for
changing the speed of the game frameskip, skipping soundsample playback,
adding scanlines, changing to BGR color format and not waiting for sound to
be played back faster performance.
