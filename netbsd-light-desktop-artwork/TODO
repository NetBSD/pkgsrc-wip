maybe split this up into files not specific to light-desktop?

note: I didn't include LXDM themes:
usr/share/lxdm/themes/Lubuntu

I can't tell if I recognize the system theme in use.
Would be good to check each of these

Need some NetBSD-themed artwork:
        352x125 logout-banner.png  
	1280x1024 netbsd-default-wallpaper.png
	64x26 (64 width includes 20+ pixels of transparency on right)
		or 36x36 netbsd-logo.png for panel menu button
