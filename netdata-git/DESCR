netdata is a system for distributed real-time performance and health monitoring.
It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the
system it runs (including applications such as web and database servers), using
modern interactive web dashboards.

netdata is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems
(physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their
core function.
