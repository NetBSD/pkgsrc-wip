Newsboat is a fork of Newsbeuter, an RSS/Atom feed reader for the
text console.  It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and other
Unix-like operating systems.  Newsboat's great configurability and
vast number of features make it a perfect choice for people that
need a slick and fast feed reader that can be completely controlled
via keyboard.  It's the Mutt of RSS feed readers.

This is the last release of newsboat which does not depend on
lang/rust to build.
