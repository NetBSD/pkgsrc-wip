newsraft is a feed reader with a ncurses user interface. It is
greatly inspired by newsboat and tries to be its lightweight
counterpart. newsraft supports parallel downloads, section-based
feeds grouping, opening links in any program, viewing news from all
feeds with explore mode, automatic updates for feeds and sections,
multiple actions key bindings, support for feed generating scripts,
text search by news titles, and interactive interface for viewing
news content.
