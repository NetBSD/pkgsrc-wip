NG-SPICE is the program being developed as the replacement for Berkeley
SPICE.  Using the Berkeley code as a starting point, the NG-SPICE team
is working on improving the build system, adding to the models, and
improving the analysis capability.

SPICE is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear dc,
nonlinear transient, and linear ac analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current
sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission
lines (two separate implementations), switches, uniform distributed RC
lines, and the five most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs,
MESFETs, and MOSFETs.

NG-SPICE is part of the gEDA project.
