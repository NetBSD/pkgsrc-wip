Nickle is a desk calculator language with powerful programming and
scripting capabilities.  Nickle supports a variety of datatypes, espe-
cially arbitrary precision integers, rationals, and imprecise reals.
The input language vaguely resembles C.  Some things in C which do not
translate easily are different, some design choices have been made dif-
ferently, and a very few features are simply missing.
