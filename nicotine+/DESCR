Nicotine is a SoulSeek client written in Python, based on the PySoulSeek
project by Alexander Kanavin. It features, among other things, a completely
rewritten graphical user interface which uses the PyGTK-2 toolkit and a less
strict user request policy.

Nicotine-Plus is a fork of Hyriand's original Nicotine Soulseek client. It is
an attempt to keep Nicotine working with the latest libraries, kill bugs, keep
current with the Soulseek protocol and add some new features that users want
and/or need. The main developer now is daelstorm.
