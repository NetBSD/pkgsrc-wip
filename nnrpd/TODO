# INN 1.7 nnrpd pkg issues

- Make sure we got all the relevant patches from 
  http://www.mibsoftware.com/userkt/inn/patches/

- Should we try to keep clear of INN heritage (/var/news etc.) to
  allow installing INN and C News at the same time?

- Fix rc.d script installation

- Install 'subscriptions' boilerplate for new users

- Make Perl and TCL support options, default to off since they probably
  will not be used on a large scale

- Add dependency to C News, since we use libcnews.a
