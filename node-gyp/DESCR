Node.js native addon build tool

node-gyp is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js
for compiling native addon modules for Node.js. It contains a
vendored copy of the gyp-next project that was previously used by
the Chromium team and extended to support the development of Node.js
native addons.
