This project provides Node.js bindings for [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2):
a fast, safe alternative to backtracking regular expression engines written by [Russ Cox](http://swtch.com/~rsc/) in C++.
To learn more about RE2, start with an overview
[Regular Expression Matching in the Wild](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html). More resources can be found
at his [Implementing Regular Expressions](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/) page.


`RE2`'s regular expression language is almost a superset of what is provided by `RegExp`
(see [Syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)),
but it lacks two features: backreferences and lookahead assertions. See below for more details.

`RE2` always works in the [Unicode mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicode), which means that all matches that use character codes are interpret as Unicode code points, not as binary values of UTF-16.
See `RE2.unicodeWarningLevel` below for more details.
