Doesn't compile at the time of the writing from standard pkgsrc.  
**** FIX: Update libnet to 1.1.1 . At the time of the writing it 
was unavailable from pkgsrc. 

This program is propably now Linux-only, but it could be ported to *BSD and
patches sent back to author (he has BSD port in plans)

Create PLIST when it compiles.

Use ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM=Linux-*-* propably if porting to NetBSD won't be
easy/possible (but it seems it _could_ be done, so I'm leaving it now)
