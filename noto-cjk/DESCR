Noto's goal is providing a beautiful reading experience for everyone and
for all languages. With visual harmony when multiple languages share a
page. With multiple styles and weights, and freely available to all.

Currently, Noto covers all major languages of the world and many others,
including European, African, Middle Eastern, Indic, South and Southeast
Asian, Central Asian, American, and East Asian languages. Several minority
and historical languages are also supported.
