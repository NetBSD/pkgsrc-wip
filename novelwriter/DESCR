novelWriter is a plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled
from many smaller text documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax
inspired by Markdown, and adds a meta data syntax for comments,
synopsis, and cross-referencing. It's designed to be a simple text
editor that allows for easy organisation of text and notes, using human
readable text files as storage for robustness.

The project storage is suitable for version control software, and also
well suited for file synchronisation tools. All text is saved as plain
text files with a meta data header. The core project structure is
stored in a single project XML file. Other meta data is primarily saved
as JSON files.
