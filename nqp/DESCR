This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like environment for
virtual machines. The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a
very small environment (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and
is focused on being a high-level way to create compilers and libraries
for virtual machines (such as the Parrot Virtual Machine [1] and the JVM).
Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6, NQP strives to have as
small a runtime footprint as it can, while still providing a Perl 6 object
model and regular expression engine for the virtual machine.
