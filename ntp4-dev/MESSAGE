$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.1.1.1 2003/08/07 01:50:59 adrian_p Exp $

THERE ARE NO MAN PAGES. All installed documentation
is accessible through

	file://localhost${PREFIX}/share/doc/html/ntp4/index.htm

User to user support is available at

	news:comp.protocols.time.ntp

and online docs are viewable through NTP's home at

	http://www.ntp.org/

To get this running on NetBSD 1.5 and above:

1.	Set ntpd=YES in /etc/rc.conf and set any flags that may be necessary 
	for your environment using ntpd_flags="".

2.	At this time the ntpd_chrootdir flag is not supported with this package.
	It must be removed from /etc/rc.conf if present.

3.	Add a file called "ntpd" to /etc/rc.conf.d with the following entries:
	command="${PREFIX}/bin/${name}".
