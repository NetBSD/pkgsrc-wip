nyan is a data description language, It is a mixture of python, json, patch,
wml, yaml and some new ideas.

It stores hierarchical objects with key-value pairs in a database with the
key idea that changes in a parent affect all children.

We created nyan because there existed no suitable language to properly
represent the enormous complexity of storing the data for openage.

The main focus is readability and moddability.
