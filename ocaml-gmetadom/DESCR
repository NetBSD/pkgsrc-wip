GMetaDOM is a collection of librares, each library providing a DOM
implementation. This is the binding for OCAML.

The basic idea is that, given the availability of DOM implementations
for the C programming language (like Gdome2), and given the uniformity
of the DOM interfaces, bindings for various programming languages based
on the C implementation can be built automatically, providing a small
number of hand-coded classes and a set of scripts for the automatic
generation of the remaining ones.
