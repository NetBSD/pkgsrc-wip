  - Fix ocaml crash during build.  Apparently ocamlopt crashes.  It
    seems reasonable to use the bytecode compiler instead, but that
    seems buried in topkg.

  - See if OPAM should be overriding do-build, or if the override in
    Makefile is ok.

  - Resolve topkg having a bl3 file, when it's a build tool.
