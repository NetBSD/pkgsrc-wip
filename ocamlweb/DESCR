Literate programming, as defined by Knuth, means to combine program code and
documentation into one source document from which program code and documentation
can be extracted. The approach of ocamlweb is that documentation is to be
included in the program code as special comments. The ocamlweb tool extracts
from this the documented program code as LaTeX document, while no special
preprocessing is required to compile the source files.
