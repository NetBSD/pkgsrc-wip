OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is
to be a secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements
the OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental)
compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol.
The OpenConnect protocol provides a dual TCP/UDP VPN channel, and
uses the standard IETF security protocols to secure it. The server
is implemented primarily for the GNU/Linux platform but its code
is designed to be portable to other UNIX variants as well.
