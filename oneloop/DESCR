ONELOOP is a program to evaluate the one-loop scalar 1-point, 2-point, 3-point
and 4-point functions, for all kinematical configurations relevant for
collider-physics, and for any non-positive imaginary parts of the internal
squared masses. It deals with all UV and IR divergences within dimensional
regularization. Furthermore, it provides routines to evaluate these functions
using straightforward numerical integration.
