Oolite is a space sim game, inspired by Elite, powered by Objective-C and
OpenGL, and designed as a small game that is easy for users to pick up,
modify and expand upon. Almost every aspect of the game can be changed by
using simple, free graphics packages and text-editors.
Originally written for Mac OS X, and under continuous development for over
three years. Oolite is available for Mac OS X (10.3.9 and higher), Windows
XP, and Linux. It requires at least a 400MHz processor, 256Mb of memory,
and a graphics card capable of accelerating OpenGL graphics.
The game and source-code are offered for free under the GNU General Public
License.
