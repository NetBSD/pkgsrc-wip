WARN: ../../doc/TODO:473: Invalid package name "beancount".
ERROR: Makefile: Each package must define its LICENSE.

	To take a good guess on the license of a package, run "make

ERROR: patches/patch-config.h:3: Each patch must be documented.

	Pkgsrc tries to have as few patches as possible. Therefore, each
	patch must document why it is necessary. Typical reasons are
	portability or security. A typical documented patch looks like this:

		$NetBSD$

		Portability fixes for GCC 4.8 on Linux.
		See https://github.com/org/repo/issues/7

		--- old/file
		+++ new/file

	Patches that are related to a security issue should mention the
	corresponding CVE identifier.

	Each patch should be sent to the upstream maintainers of the
	package, so that they can include it in future versions. After
	submitting a patch upstream, the corresponding bug report should be
	mentioned in this file, to prevent duplicate work.
