Description from OpenLane Documentation

Unfortunately, popular open-source Verilog simulators don't have support for
SDF (Verilator) or have limited support that is not entirely useful (iverilog).
However, there is a less popular free-of-charge Verilog simulator called CVC by
Tachyon DA that has decent support for timing simulation using SDF files. CVC
is a proprietary shared source simulator, but its license allows using it
freely for non-commercial designs.
