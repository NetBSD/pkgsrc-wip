AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc
Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs).  It offers a client-server
architecture for file sharing, providing location independence,
scalability and transparent migration capabilities for data.  IBM
branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance.  They called the
release OpenAFS.

To build the kernel module
    $ cd src/libafs
    $ cp MakefileProto.NBSD Makefile
    $ make obj && make && make install
