OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application
platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems based on JavaSE.
It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with
the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured
toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open
source project where we develop JavaFX.

OpenJFX is free software, licensed under GPL v2 with the Classpath
exception, just like the JDK. Anybody is welcome to contribute to
this project, port it to other platforms or devices, or do anything
else that a free software license allows you to do!

This package tacks OpenJFX 23.
