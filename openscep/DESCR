SCEP is a simple protocol that runs over http.  The server runs a CGI
script http://.../cgi-bin/pkiclient.exe.  Cisco equipment (PIX, IOS)
needs to become an SCEP client to guide it by the hand through the
process of loading a CA certificate into itself, downloading CRLs, and
enrolling its device certificate into the CA.  Cisco devices generate
their own certificate requests, and the private key never leaves the
device.  SCEP is kind of silly, but you can't use certificates with Cisco
unless you use SCEP, so, here it is.

oh, guess what, you need LDAP to use it.  enjoy!
