0. in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/openscep.cnf, edit:
    ldapbase
    binddn
    bindpw

1. run openscepsetup to prepare the OpenSSL mini-CA in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}

2. set up openldap, and start slapd

   0. optionally use my fancified openldap by applying
      files/openldap-package.diff for faster setup
   1. set slapd_chrootdir in rc.conf
   2. use slappasswd program to set rootpw in slapd.conf to match the
      bindpw you set above
   3. add this line to slapd.conf:

include ${PKG_SYSCONFBASE}/openldap/schema/openscep.schema

3. run 'openscepsetup ldap' to load the CA certificate and CRL into LDAP.

4. add to root's crontab a line like

   0       */8     *       *       *       ${PREFIX}/sbin/createcrl

   to rebuild the CRL three times a day

5. apache.  Once you start apache, the cgi-bin/pkiclient.exe script should
   already be runnable by any web browser.  In addition, if you've used
   the discouraged PKG_OPTIONS.openscep=openscep-web-ui, you'll definitely
   want to do substantial Apache configuration to password-protect the
   ${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin/openscep directory, or else anyone will be
   able to manipulate your CA.

6. A typical application is to load one certificate into an IPsec
   security gateway (IOS or PIX) using SCEP, and then sign many client
   certificates for road warriors without using SCEP.  See comments in
   ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/openscep.cnf for instructions on signing and
   revoking road warrior certificates manually with openssl commands.
