The Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is a framework of several
services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning
and vulnerability management solution.

The OpenVAS Manager is a layer between the OpenVAS Scanner and various client
applications such as the web client GSA (Greenbone Security Assistant), the
command line client omp (of openvas-cli) and the classic application GSD
(Greenbone Security Desktop).  Among other features, it adds server-side
storage of scan results and it removes the need for a scan client to keep the
connection open until the scan finishes. All communication between OpenVAS
Manager and its clients is done via the XML-based OpenVAS Management Protocol
(OMP).
