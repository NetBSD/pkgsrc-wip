OpenVDB is an open source C++ library comprising a novel hierarchical
data structure and a large suite of tools for the efficient storage and
manipulation of sparse volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional
grids. It was developed by DreamWorks Animation for use in volumetric
applications typically encountered in feature film production.
