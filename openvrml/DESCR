OpenVRML is a portable C++ library for reading and displaying VRML97
files.  This distribution includes lookat, a sample viewer program that
uses GLUT. OpenVRML aspires to full conformance to the VRML97 specification.
It isn't there yet, but much of the spec is supported, and OpenVRML will
continue to get better.
