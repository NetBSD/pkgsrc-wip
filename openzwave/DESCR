Our goal is to create free software library that interfaces with
selected Z-Wave PC controllers, allowing anyone to create applications
that manipulate and respond to devices on a Z-Wave network, without
requiring in-depth knowledge of the Z-Wave protocol.

This software is currently aimed at Application Developers who wish to
incorporate Z-Wave functionality into their applications.
