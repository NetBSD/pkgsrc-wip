Or1ksim is a generic OpenRISC 1000 architecture simulator capable of
emulating OpenRISC based computer systems.
The goal is to simulate 32-bit and 64-bit OpenRISC CPUs and enough surrounding
hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified) operating
systems, such as NetBSD, RTEMS, eCos and Linux.

Or1ksim provides several unique features:

    * Free, open source code.
    * High level, fast architecture simulation that allows early code
      analysis and system performance evaluation.
    * All major models of OpenCores peripheral and system controller
      cores supportedi.
    * Easy addition of new peripheral models.
    * Remote debugging through a network socket with the GNU Debugger (GDB).
    * Support for different environments (memory configurations and sizes,
      OR1K processor model, configuration of peripheral devices).
