The orbifolder is a program developed in C++ that computes and analyzes the
low-energy effective theory of heterotic orbifold compactifications.
The program includes routines to compute the massless spectrum, to identify
the allowed couplings in the superpotential, to automatically generate large
sets of orbifold models, to identify phenomenologically interesting models (e.g.
MSSM-like models) and to analyze their vacuum-configurations
