Orion is a window manager for the X11 windowing system.  Orion is written in
Scheme and accesses Xlib via the scx library for scsh.  Orion is in fact a
family of window managers that can be nested. This enables great flexibility
and efficient handling of X11 applications. Orion currently comes with four
child window managers:

* a conventional moving window manager
* a window manager for stacking windows in a frame
* a window manager for splitting windows horizontally and vertically
* a work space manager

Orion also supports saving the window manager layout and programmatic
configuration.
