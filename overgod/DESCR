For too long has humanity been ruled by cruel and disputatious
gods! Fly through the various layers of the Celestial Oversphere
to unseat those who control the universe.

Basically, you control a little vehicle in the middle of the screen
and fly around and shoot things - a bit like asteroids, but the
asteroids move independently and shoot back. You can also upgrade
your vehicle in various ways.

Features include:
- Over 100 different enemies
- Lots of randomness and chaos
- Various different modes and unlockable challenges
- 1 or 2 players (splitscreen)
- Pretty low system requirements (about 300MHz is plenty, and it
  doesn't need any kind of fancy graphics card)
- Days of fun!
