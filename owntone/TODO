"GNU gperf not found, but it's output appears to be present."

- it's using /usr/pkg/* for things like pid and db; not sure if that's
  correct.

- set ownership of db directory:
    /usr/pkg/var/cache/owntone/
  to `owntone`

- need to figure out ALSA so mpd mode can be tested

- config file should be installed into share/examples/owntone and
  installed using CONF_FILES.

- need to define the runtime dependency list

  had to also start avahi and dbus-daemon

- build and install web interface (separate package?).

Upstream bugs:

- filescanner_ffmpeg.c needs patching
