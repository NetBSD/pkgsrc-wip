The purpose of this module is to perform a user authentication via Microsoft's
NTLM protocol. This protocol is supported by all versions of the Internet
Explorer and is mainly useful for intranets. Depending on your preferences
setting, IE will supply your windows logon credentials to the web server
when the server asks for NTLM authentication. This saves the user to type in
his/her password again.
