* Installation dirs must be changed. There's already a p5-Asterisk
package with a newer version than the included in this package.
Nevertheless, as writting this, the VICIdial-astguiclient 2.13
package only works with this version. Thus, we had to import this
outdated version. If you have the previously  mentioned package
installed, please change the install directories of this package.
