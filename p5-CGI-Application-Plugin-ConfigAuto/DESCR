CGI::Application::Plugin::ConfigAuto adds easy access
to config file variables to your CGI::Application modules.
Lazy loading is used to prevent the config file from being
parsed if no configuration variables are accessed during
the request.
n other words, the config file is not parsed until it is
actually needed.
