The forward method passes control to another run mode and returns its output.
This is equivalent to calling $self->$other_runmode, except that
CGI::Application's internal value of the current run mode is updated.
This means that calling $self->get_current_runmode after calling forward will
return the name of the new run mode.
This is useful for modules that depend on the name of the current run mode
such as CGI::Application::Plugin::AnyTemplate.
