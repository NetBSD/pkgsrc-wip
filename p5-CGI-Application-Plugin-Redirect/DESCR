This plugin provides an easy way to do external redirects in CGI::Application.
You don't have to worry about setting headers or worrying about return types,
as that is all handled for you.
redirect does an external redirect, which means that the browser will
receive a command to load a new page, and a fresh request will come in.
If you just want to display the results of another runmode
within the same module, then it is often sufficient to use
the forward method in CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward
instead.
