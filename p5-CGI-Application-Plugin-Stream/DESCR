This plugin provides a way to stream a file back to the user.
This is useful if you are creating a PDF or Spreadsheet document
dynamically to deliver to the user.
The file is read and printed in small chunks to keep
memory consumption down.
This plugin is a consumer, as in your runmode shouldn't try to do
any output or anything afterwards This plugin affects the HTTP
response headers, so anything you do afterwards will probably not work.
