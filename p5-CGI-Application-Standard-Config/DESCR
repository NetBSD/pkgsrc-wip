CGI::Application::Standard::Config -- Define a standard configuration
API for CGI::Application.
This module defines a minimum standard interface that configuration
plugins for CGI::Application should meet.
Having such a standard allows other plugin authors to rely on basic
configuration functionality without coding exceptions for several
configuration modules or giving up on such integration.
