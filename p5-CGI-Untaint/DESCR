Dealing with large web based applications with multiple forms is a minefield.
It's often hard enough to ensure you validate all your input at all, without
having to worry about doing it in a consistent manner. If any of the validation
rules change, you often have to alter them in many different places.
And, if you want to operate taint-safe, then you're just adding even
more headaches.

This module provides a simple, convenient, abstracted and extensible manner
for validating and untainting the input from web forms.

You simply create a handler with a hash of your parameters (usually $q->Vars),
and then iterate over the fields you wish to extract, performing whatever
validations you choose.
The resulting variable is guaranteed not only to be valid, but also untainted
