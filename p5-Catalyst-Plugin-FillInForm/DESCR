Fill forms automatically, based on data from a previous HTML form. Typically
(but not necessarily) used in conjunction with the
Catalyst::Plugin::FormValidator manpage. This module automatically inserts data
from a previous HTML form into HTML input fields, textarea fields, radio
buttons, checkboxes, and select tags. It is an instance of the HTML::FillInForm
manpage, which itself is a subclass of the HTML::Parser manpage, which it uses
to parse the HTML and insert the values into the proper form tags.

The usual application is after a user submits an HTML form without filling out
a required field, or with errors in fields having specified constraints.
FillInForm is used to redisplay the HTML form with all the form elements
containing the submitted info. FillInForm can also be used to fill forms with
data from any source, e.g. directly from your database.
