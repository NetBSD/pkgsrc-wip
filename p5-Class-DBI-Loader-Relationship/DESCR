This module acts as a mix-in, adding the relationship method to
Class::DBI::Loader. Since Class::DBI::Loader knows how to map
between table names and class names, there ought to be no need
to replicate the names.

In addition, it is common (but not universal) to want reverse
relationships defined for has-many relationships, and for
has-a relationships to be defined for the linkages surrounding
a many-to-many table.

The aim of CDBIL::Relationship is to simplify the declaration
of common database relationships by providing both of these
features.

The relationship takes a string. It recognises table names
(singular or plural, for convenience) and extracts them
from the "sentence".assss
