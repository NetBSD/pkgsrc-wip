Crypt::PKCS10 parses PKCS #10 certificate requests (CSRs) and provides
ccessor methods to extract the data in usable form.

Common object identifiers will be translated to their corresponding names.
Additionally, accessor methods allow extraction of single data fields.
The format of returned data varies by accessor.

The access methods return the value corresponding to their name. If called
in scalar context, they return the first value (or an empty string). If called
in array context, they return all values.
