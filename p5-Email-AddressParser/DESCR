Near drop-in replacement for the regex parsing of Email::Address, which
has serious issues for production use (exponential to infinite computation
time in some cases). It uses code from Mark Crispin's c-client library
to implement the parsing. The resulting parser is much more stable than
the regex-based version of Email::Address.
