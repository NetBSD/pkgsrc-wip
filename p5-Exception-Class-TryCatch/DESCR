Exception::Class::TryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use
with Exception::Class using the familiar keywords try and catch.
Its primary objective is to allow users to avoid dealing
directly with $@ by ensuring that any exceptions caught
in an eval are captured as Exception::Class objects,
whether they were thrown objects to begin with or whether the error
resulted from die. This means that users may immediately use isa
and various Exception::Class methods to process the exception.
n addition, this module provides for a method to push errors
onto a hidden error stack immediately after an eval so that cleanup
code or other error handling may also call eval without
the original error in $@ being lost.
