FCGI::Daemon is a small FastCGI server for use as CGI-wrapper for
CGI applications.

Like mod_perl, FCGI-Daemon stays persistent in memory to accelerate
unmodified CGI applications written in Perl.

FCGI-Daemon run CGI scripts with RLIMITs and predefined number of
workers.

FCGI-Daemon checks for executable in path and correctly sets
PATH_INFO environment variable which is crucial for some CGI
applications like fossil (http://fossil-scm.org).
