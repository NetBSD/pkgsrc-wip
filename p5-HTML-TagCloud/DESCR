The HTML::TagCloud module enables you to generate "tag clouds"
in HTML. Tag clouds serve as a textual way to visualize terms
and topics that are used most frequently.  The tags are sorted
alphabetically and a larger font is used to indicate more frequent term usage.

Example sites with tag clouds: <http://www.43things.com/>,
<http://www.astray.com/recipes/> and <http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/>.

This module provides a simple interface to generating a CSS-based HTML tag
cloud.  You simply pass in a set of tags, their URL and their count. This
module outputs stylesheet-based HTML. You may use the included CSS or
use your own.
