WebMake is a simple content management system, based around a templating system
for HTML documents, with lots of built-in smarts about what a "typical"
informational website needs in the way of functionality; metadata,
sitemapping, navigational aids, and (of course) embedded perl code. ;)

It requires no dynamic scripting capabilities on the server; WebMake sites can
be deployed to a plain old FTP site without any problems.

It allows the separation of responsibilities between the content editors, the
HTML page designers, and the site architect; only the site architect needs to
edit the WebMake file itself, or know perl or WebMake code.
