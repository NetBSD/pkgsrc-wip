A Hash::AsObject is a blessed hash that provides
read-write access to its elements using accessors.
(Actually, they're both accessors and mutators.)

It's designed to act as much like a plain hash as
possible; this means, for example, that you can use
methods like DESTROY to get or set hash elements
with that name. See below for more information.
