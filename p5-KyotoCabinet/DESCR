Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.
The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a
pair of a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes
with variable length.  Both binary data and character string can
be used as a key and a value.  Each key must be unique within a
database.  There is neither concept of data tables nor data types.
Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.

The package provides Perl binding for Kyoto Cabinet database.
