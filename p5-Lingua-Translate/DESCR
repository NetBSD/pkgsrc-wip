Lingua::Translate translates text from one written language to another.
Currently this is implemented by contacting Babelfish
(http://babelfish.altavista.com/), so see there for the language pairs that
are supported. Babelfish uses SysTran (http://www.systran.org/) to perform the
translation, and contacting a SysTran translation server directly is also
supported (in case your translation needs grow beyond babelfish' capacity).
