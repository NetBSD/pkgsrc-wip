MMapDB implements a database similar to a hash of hashes of hashes, ...,
of arrays of data.

It's main design goals were:
    * very fast read access
    * lock-free read access for massive parallelism
    * minimal memory consumption per accessing process
    * transaction based write access
    * simple backup, compactness, one file
