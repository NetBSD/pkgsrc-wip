MasonX::Apache2Handler is experimental (beta) and should only be
used in a test environment. The MasonX::Apache2Handler module itself
is a simple clone of Mason's HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler, and, as
such, seems to be solid. However the components used, mod_perl 2
and libapreq2, are currently under development.
