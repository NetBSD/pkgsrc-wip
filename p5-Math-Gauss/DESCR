This module provides, for the Gaussian probability distribution:
- the probability density
- the cumulative distribution function
- the inverse of the cumulative distribution function
in one convenient bundle.

The emphasis is on simplicity and portability (pure Perl!), with
"good enough" accuracy in the results.
