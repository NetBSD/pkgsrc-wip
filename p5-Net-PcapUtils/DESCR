This module provides some code to abstract away some of the messier
parts of using the Net::Pcap library.  The idea is to be able to write
"one-liner" type scripts for packet capture without getting bogged
down in the initialisation code.  This makes it possible to write very
compact Perl scripts involving packet capture.
