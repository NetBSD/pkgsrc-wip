This module is an office document management interface. It allows the
users to create or transform office documents, or to extract data from
them. It can handle files which comply with the ODF standard and whose
type is text (odt), spreadsheet (ods), presentation (odp) or drawing
(odg). It interacts directly with the files and doesn't depend on a
particular office software.
