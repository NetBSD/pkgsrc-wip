pod2it is the italian translation project of core Perl pods. This has
been (and currently still is) a very big work! :-)

See http://pod2it.sf.net for more details about the project.

Once the package has been installed, the translated documentation can
be accessed with:

  %> perldoc POD2::IT::<podname>
