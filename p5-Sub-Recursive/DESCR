Recursive closures suffer from a severe memory leak. Sub::Recursive
makes the problem go away cleanly and at the same time allows you to
write recursive subroutines as expression and can make them truly
anonymous. There's no significant speed difference between using
&recursive and writing the simpler leaking solution.
