This module provides syntax highlighting for Perl code.
The design bias is roughly line-oriented and streamed
(ie, processing a file line-by-line in a single
pass).
Provisions may be made in the future for tasks related
to "back-tracking"
(ie, re-doing a single line in the middle of a stream)
such as speeding up state copying.
