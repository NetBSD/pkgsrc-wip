Test::Assertions::TestScript provides a base for writing test scripts.
It performs some common actions such as setting up the @INC path
and parsing command-line options, specifically:
* The lib and t/lib directories are added to @INC.
* The current directory is changed to the directory the script is in.
* Test script command-line options are parsed. (See "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS")
* The test set of functions from Test::Assertions are
imported into your test script.
Test::Assertions::TestScript makes certain assumptions about 
the filesystem layout of your project:
* Modules that you are testing are in the lib directory of your project.
* There may also be a t/lib directory for any modules written
for the test process.
