This is a front-end for the DB_File package.

If you tie a hash in read-only mode, this module puts a shared lock on
the database file, copies it to a temporary file, unlocks the original
database, and then ties the tempfile using DB_File.

If you tie the hash in read-write mode, we put an exclusive lock on the
database and tie it directly using DB_File.
