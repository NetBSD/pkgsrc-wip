The UUID library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects
that may be accessible beyond the local system. For instance, they
could be used to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple web
servers without communication between the servers, and without fear
of a name clash.

The generated UUIDs can be reasonably expected to be unique within
a system, and unique across all systems, and are compatible with
those created by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE) utility uuidgen.
