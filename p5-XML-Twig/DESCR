XML::Twig is (yet another!) XML transformation module. 
 
Its strong points: can be used to process huge documents while still
being in tree mode; not bound by DOM or SAX, so it is very perlish and
offers a very comprehensive set of methods; simple to use; DWIMs as
much as possible.

What it doesn't offer: full SAX support (it can export SAX, but only
reads XML), full XPath support (unless you use XML::Twig::XPath), nor
DOM support.
 
Other drawbacks: it is a big module, and with over 500 methods available
it can be a bit overwhelming. A good starting point is the tutorial at
http://xmltwig.org/xmltwig/tutorial/index.html. In fact the whole
XML::Twig page at http://xmltwig.org/xmltwig/ has plenty of information
to get you started with XML::Twig.
