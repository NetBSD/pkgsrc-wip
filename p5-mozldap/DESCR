p5-mozldap is also known as PerLDAP.
PerLDAP, Perl-LDAP, is made up of two main components to write LDAP clients:
An interface to the C SDK API, and a set of Object Oriented Perl classes.
The API interface is almost 100% compatible with Netscape's C SDK, but it's
harder to use than the OO layer. The Object oriented interface is ment to be
an easier way to write most common LDAP clients
