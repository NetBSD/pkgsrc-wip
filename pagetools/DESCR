Page Layout Detection Tools is a project aiming to automate the layout
detection in scanned page images. This task is a necessary step in OCR
processing. One would like to detect the orientation of the text, to
determine the text bounding box(es) for the text and graphics, to deskew
the page images if necessary, and to remove scanning artifacts (dirt,
speckles, shadows).

The entire code will be distributed under the conditions of the GPL.

The initial implementation works with black/white images in TIFF or PBM
format. The first application in the project is a program to determine
the skew angle for text. This is performed using an original algorithm
based on a fast implementation of the Radon transform. (The fast Radon
code was received from an anonymous contributor who has allowed us to
publish the code under GPL.)
