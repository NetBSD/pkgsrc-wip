This Linux-PAM login module allows a X.509 certificate based user login.
The certificate and its dedicated private key are thereby accessed by means
of an appropriate PKCS #11 module. For the verification of the users'
certificates, locally stored CA certificates as well as either online or
locally accessible CRLs are used.
