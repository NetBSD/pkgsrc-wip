PulseAudio Preferences (paprefs) is a simple GTK based configuration dialog
for the PulseAudio sound server.

Please note that this program can only configure local servers, and requires
that a special module module-gconf is loaded in the sound server. (Since
PulseAudio 0.9.5 this modules is loaded by default.)
