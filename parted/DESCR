GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful for creating
space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and
copying data to new hard disks.

Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and PC98
disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type
which allows use on RAID/LVM.  Filesystems which are currently
fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16 and FAT32), ReiserFS
(with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.  Parted can also detect and
remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/
APFS (Amiga) filesystems, but cannot create, resize or check these
filesystems yet.

Use at your own risk.
