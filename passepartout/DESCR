Passepartout is an open source desktop publishing (DTP) application
for the X Window System environment. The focus is to make it easy to
create publications, like magazines, brochures and leaflets, with a
flexible layout.

The goal of the passepartout project is to create a system capable of
producing pre-press material of professional quality, while also being
useful for any enthusiast for creating formatted documents.

It features a user-friendly GTK+-based interface, layout templates, an
XML-based typesetting engine called xml2ps, user-defined text formatting
with XSLT stylesheets, Unicode support, EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
file importing, importing many image formats, text running around image
or text frames, and printing to PostScript and EPS formats.
