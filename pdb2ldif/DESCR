Perl program to convert Palm Address Book (AddressDB.pdb) files
to .ldif files, which can be easily imported into an LDAP
directory with the following command:

 cat <file.ldif> | ldapadd -w <passwd> -D <binddn>

or even more easy:

 pdb2ldif --pdb=<address.pdb> | ldapadd -w <passwd> -D <binddn>

The program takes --pdb= as the PDB file and directs output to <STDOUT>.
If you're very crafty, you can probably do a lot more with unix pipes,
but this should be acceptable for most people.

Requires p5-Palm libraries (available separately)
Getopt is also required, but should have been part of your Perl distro.

Y2K issues:  Good until 2038, they you'll need a 64-bit processor :-)
