The pdfjam package makes available the pdfjam shell script that
provides a simple interface to much of the functionality of the
excellent pdfpages package (by Andreas Matthias) for LaTeX. The
pdfjam script takes one or more PDF files (and/or JPG/PNG graphics
files) as input, and produces one or more PDF files as output. It
is useful for joining files together, selecting pages, reducing
several source pages onto one output page, etc., etc.
