The Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library (PEGTL) is a zero-dependency
C++ header-only parser combinator library for creating parsers according to a
Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG).

Grammars are written as regular C++ code, created with template programming
(not template meta programming), i.e. nested template instantiations that
naturally correspond to the inductive definition of PEGs (and other
parser-combinator approaches).
