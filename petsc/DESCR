PETSc is the "Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation", a suite
of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific
applications modeled by partial differential equations. It employs the MPI
standard for all message-passing communication. Several sample scientific
applications, as well as various papers  and talks, demonstrate the features of
the PETSc libraries
