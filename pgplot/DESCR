The PGPLOT Graphics Subroutine Library is a Fortran- or C-callable,
device-independent graphics package for making simple scientific
graphs. It is intended for making graphical images of publication
quality with minimum effort on the part of the user. For most
applications, the program can be device-independent, and the output
can be directed to the appropriate device at run time.
