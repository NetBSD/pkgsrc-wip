Pharo is a mininal, elegant, pure, reflective object language (and
fully open-source).

    - Yes in Pharo they are only objects! Nothing else.
    - Yes the complete syntax of Pharo fits on a postcard and
    - Yes we code in the debugger and Pharo has super cool tools that
      empower you and make you super efficient.
