Phonon is the Multimedia API for KDE and QT.

In Phonon there are three main concepts: MediaObjects, Paths and Outputs.
The MediaObjects control the playback/capture and provide the media data.
MediaObjects can be connected to Outputs using Path objects which also
allow the insertion of Effect objects between MediaObject and Output.
