Dotclear's proposed aim is to develop a software that fully respects web
standards based on open source solutions, with multilingual interface and
publishing capabilities. It is written in PHP.
Notable features include handling many blogs, using Wiki or XHTML syntax for
entries, adding pages that are independent from the flow of entries and support
for several database types: (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
