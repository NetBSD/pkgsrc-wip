Snuffleupagus is a PHP 7+ module designed to drastically raise the cost of
attacks against websites, by killing entire bug classes. It also provides a
powerful virtual-patching system, allowing administrator to fix specific
vulnerabilities and audit suspicious behaviours without having to touch the
PHP code.
