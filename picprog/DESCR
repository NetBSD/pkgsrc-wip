PICmicro microcontrollers, or MCUs, are fine chips that are especially easy
to program with a simple device attached to a parallel or serial port.
Because of the EEPROM or Flash memory, they are also easy and fast to erase
and reprogram without need for UV equipment. This makes them very popular
among electronics hobbyists.

At the moment this is the second implementation of a PIC programmer for
Linux that works with the very simple and cheap serial port programmers.
The first one I know was made by Ralph Metzler in 1996. My programmer was
originally designed for PIC16C84 and PIC16F84 chips back in 1997, and since
then I have implemented other chips without access to most of them. I have
tested PIC16F628, PIC16F676, PIC12F675, PIC16F88, PIC16F876A, PIC16F76,
PIC18F1320 and PIC18F458. Others have used many other models. The dsPIC30
family has some code in the sources, but the support is not finished yet.
Some 12 bit chips should be supported but I have not tested that support.
