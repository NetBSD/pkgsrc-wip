Pike is a general purpose programming language, which means that you can
put it to use for almost any task. Its application domain spans anything
from the world of the Net to the world of multimedia applications, or
environments where your shell could use some spicy text processing or
system administration tools. Your imagination sets the limit, but Pike
will probably extend it far beyond what you previously considered within
reach.
