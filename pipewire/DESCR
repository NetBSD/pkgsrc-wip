# PipeWire

[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) is a server and user space API to
deal with multimedia pipelines. This includes:

  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
    application provided streams) and multiplexing this with
    clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.

Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes,
communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd
passing.

## Building and installation

The preferred way to install PipeWire is to install it with your
distribution package system. This ensures PipeWire is integrated
into the rest of your system for the best experience.
