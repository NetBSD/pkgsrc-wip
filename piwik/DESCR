Liberating Web Analytics. Star us on Github? +1. Piwik is the leading open
alternative to Google Analytics that gives you full control over your
data. Piwik lets you easily collect data from websites, apps & IoT and
visualise this data and extract insights. We love Pull Requests!

This is the preparation package to install piwik. You need more work after
this package installed. (And worse, may not complete easily).
See TODO.
