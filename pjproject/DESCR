PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C
language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN,
TURN, and ICE. It combines signaling protocol (SIP) with rich multimedia
framework and NAT traversal functionality into high level API that is portable
and suitable for almost any type of systems ranging from desktops, embedded
systems, to mobile handsets.

PJSIP is both compact and feature rich. It supports audio, video, presence, and
instant messaging, and has extensive documentation. PJSIP is very portable. On
mobile devices, it abstracts system dependent features and in many cases is able
to utilize the native multimedia capabilities of the device.
