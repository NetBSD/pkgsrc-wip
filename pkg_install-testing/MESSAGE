This is a testing version of the pkg_install.

As you can see, it allows installation.

The old -u option has been replaced with an overwrite
upgrade. Use -r for the old pkg_delete before update
method. See the new pkg_add man page for details.

Currently, the files no longer needed after an -u
upgrade are not deleted. After some more testing
this will be turned on.

Please share your feedback.
