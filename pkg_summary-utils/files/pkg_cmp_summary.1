.Ar pkg_summary1 pkg_summary2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
compares package versions in two pkg_summary(5) files.
These files may be generated by pkg_info -X, pkg_src_summary(1)
and other utils.
Actually only PKGNAME fields (and optionally PKGPATH) are used
for comparison.
.
Format of the results:
  <R> [PKGPATH] <PKGBASE> <VER1> <VER2>
 where R is
  -     present in the first file but absent in the second one (disappears)
  +     absent in the first file but present in the second one (appears/new)
  <NUM> more than one package with the same PKGBASE is in the first file
  =     versions are the same
  <     second file contains newer version
  >     second file contains earlier version
  ?     versions are incomparable (incorrect version, for example)
.
 PKGBASE is PKGNAME with version stripped,
VER1 and VER2 are package versions. VER2 is present only if
   R is `<' or `>'. PKGPATH appears in output if -p option is specified.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
display help message
.It Fl p
use PKGPATH:PKGBASE pair for identifing a package, by default only PKGBASE
is used to identify the package.
