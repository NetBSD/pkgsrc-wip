pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
development frameworks. It is similar to pkg-config, but was written from
scratch in the summer of 2011 to replace pkg-config, which now needs itself
to build itself (or you can set a bunch of environment variables, both are
pretty ugly).
