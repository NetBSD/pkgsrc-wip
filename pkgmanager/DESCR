A package manager for pkgsrc that allows non-intrusive upgrading of a
pkgsrc installation. Upgrading packages does not mean having to remove
all parts of the package hierarchy that depend on the packages that
are out of date. Instead, all packages are upgraded 'in place', and
all packages deending on updated packages are rebuild afterwards.
