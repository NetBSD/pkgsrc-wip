plantri and fullgen are programs for generation of certain types of planar graph
The authors are Gunnar Brinkmann (University of Ghent) and
Brendan McKay (Australian National University).

Graphs are generated in such a way that exactly one member of each isomorphism
class is output without the need for storing them. The speed of generation
is more than 1,000,000 graphs per second in many cases, so extremely large
classes of  graph can be exhaustively listed
