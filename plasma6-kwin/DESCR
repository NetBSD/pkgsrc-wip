KWin is an easy to use, but flexible, compositor for Wayland on Linux. Its
primary usage is in conjunction with a Desktop Shell (e.g. KDE Plasma Desktop).
KWin is designed to go out of the way; users should not notice that they use
a window manager at all. Nevertheless KWin provides a steep learning curve for
advanced features, which are available, if they do not conflict with the primary
mission. KWin does not have a dedicated targeted user group, but follows the
targeted user group of the Desktop Shell using KWin as it's window manager.

KWin is not...
 * a standalone Wayland compositor (c.f. labwc, sway) and does not provide any
   functionality belonging to a Desktop Shell.
 * a replacement for window managers designed for use with a specific Desktop
   Shell (e.g. GNOME Shell)
 * a minimalistic window manager
 * designed for use with network transparency, though it is possible (with e.g.
   waypipe).
