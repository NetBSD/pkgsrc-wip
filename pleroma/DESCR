Pleroma is a microblogging server software that can federate
(= exchange messages with) other servers that support ActivityPub.
What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your
friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange
messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma will federate with all
servers that implement ActivityPub, like Friendica, GNU Social, Hubzilla,
Mastodon, Misskey, Peertube, and Pixelfed.

Pleroma is written in Elixir and uses PostgresSQL for data storage.
It's efficient enough to be ran on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi.
