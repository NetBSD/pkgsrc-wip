PLplot is a library of functions that are useful for making scientific plots.
PLplot can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++, FORTRAN and
Java, and interactively from interpreted languages such as Octave, Python, Perl
and Tcl.
The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semilog plots,
log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar charts and
pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed
 on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.
A variety of output file devices such as Postscript, png, jpeg and others,
as well as interactive devices such as xwin, tk, xterm and Tektronics devices
are supported. New devices can be easily added by writing a small number of
device dependent routines.
There are almost 2000 characters in the extended character set. This includes
four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical,
and other symbols. Some devices supports its own way of dealing with text,
such as the Postscript driver, or the png and jpeg drivers that uses the
Freetype library.
