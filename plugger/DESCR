Tired of getting teased by Windows users because your Mozilla isn't as
|<()()|_ as theirs?  Well, your problems are almost solved.  Plugger is a
multimedia plugin for Unix Netscape, Mozilla or Opera that handles
Quicktime, MPEG, MP2, AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim, MIDI, AU, WAV,
Soundtracker, and Commodore 64 audio files.  And now, with Plugger 4.0,
MPEG audio and video can be played streaming.  No more waiting!  Plugger is
a very small plugin, because Plugger uses external programs to show/play
the different formats.

This is the non-binary version.
