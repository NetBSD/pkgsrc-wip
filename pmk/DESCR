The Pre Make Kit project is a toolkit providing a collection of tools
aimed to ease a lot of stages in project development. It provides a
scanner that generate template source components such as configuration
file or makefile. It also provides a dependency checker that sets up
templates files depending on the system components (such as auto* tools
or similar projects). For portability purpose, a BSD like install
program is also part of the kit.

The project aims the following goals :
- opensource (BSD licensed)
- portability (ISO C, POSIX, compatibility layer)
- speed and memory lighweight (compiled C binaries)
- security (replace scripts by data files, priviledge separation)
- simplicity of use (generation tools, few basic instructions)
- dependency low cost (only needs a POSIX shell and a C compiler)

The provided tools are:
- pmksetup: static data gathering tool
- pmk: dependency checker
- pmkscan: source scanner and build file generator
- pmkinstall: BSD like install program
- pmkpc: pkg-config compatible tool
