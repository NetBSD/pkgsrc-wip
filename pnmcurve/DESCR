pnmcurve applies tone curves to pnm images. Curves are specified as a set of
control points of a cubic spline. pnmcurve applies the resulting spline curve to
the pnm image read from stdin and writes the resulting image to stdout. Command
line switches allow to apply the curve only to selected color channels. By
default pnmcurve applies the curve to all color channels.
