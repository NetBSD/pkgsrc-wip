salo@netbsd.org:

 1) remove trailing whitespace from DISTNAME:
 
    WARN: ./Makefile 4: whitespace before end of line.
    FATAL: version number part of PKGNAME, which is derived from
           DISTNAME, looks illegal. You should modify "-1.2.1
 
 2) missing build dependency on archivers/zip
 
 3) don't use USE_X11BASE unless you know why you are doing it :)
 
 4) make sure when GNOME and/or KDE is installed (i don't have any of
    them installed), the configure DTRT:
 
     checking for kde-config... no
     checking for KDEDIR... no
     checking for GNOME data directory... gnome-config: not found
     no
 
 5) you should check what are the benefits with DB support and include
    appropriate buildlink2.mk file if it's worth adding:
 
     checking for library containing db_create... no
     configure: warning: 
     *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 
     Cannot find Berkeley DB >= 3.1, poEdit will build w/o translation memory feature!
     *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 
 
 6) i'd sort CATEGORIES, it's still an editor, not matter how specific so
    i'd say it should go to editors/
