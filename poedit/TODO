missing features:

- make db3 support optional (POEDIT_USE_DB3, default YES)
- package could use db4 as well, so it might be good to allow it's use instead
  of db3 (POEDIT_USE_DB4, default NO)

remaining issues:

- idle running poedit eats ~10%(!) cpu on my machine
- poedit can't start on -current at all for me at this moment:

  Error detected, file "/usr/src/lib/libpthread/pthread_mutex.c", line 338,
  function "pthread_mutex_unlock": Unlocking mutex owned by another thread.
