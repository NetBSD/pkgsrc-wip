written in C. PolarSSL is written with embedded systems in mind and has
been ported on a number of architectures, including ARM, PowerPC, MIPS
and Motorola 68000.

Features include:
 * Small memory footprint
 * Clean and simple API for integration
 * Loose coupling of cryptographic code.
 * Symmetric encryption algorithms: AES, Triple-DES, DES, ARC4, Camellia, XTEA
 * Hash algorithms: MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
 * HAVEGE random number generator
 * RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
 * SSL version 3 and TLS version 1 client support
 * X.509 certificate and CRL reading from memory or disk in PEM and DER formats
 * Over 900 regression and code coverage tests
 * Example applications
