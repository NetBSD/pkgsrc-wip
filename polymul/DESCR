Polymul is a self-contained C++ template library for efficient multiplication
of multivariate polynomials. It is intended for low order polynomials of a few
variables, but is in principle limited only by the compiler's maximum template
recursion depth.Polynomials can be created over any scalar type, such as
integers or floating point numbers.

In addition to normal polynomial multiplication the library can also do
truncated (Taylor series) multiplication, as well as linear changes of
coordinates. Polynomials can also be evaluated at arbitrary points.
