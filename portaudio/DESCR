# PortAudio - portable audio I/O library

PortAudio is a portable audio I/O library designed for cross-platform
support of audio. It uses either a callback mechanism to request audio
processing, or blocking read/write calls to buffer data between the
native audio subsystem and the client. Audio can be processed in various
formats, including 32 bit floating point, and will be converted to the
native format internally.

## Documentation:

* Documentation is available at http://www.portaudio.com/docs/
* Or at `/doc/html/index.html` after running Doxygen.
* Also see `src/common/portaudio.h` for the API spec.
* And see the `examples/` and `test/` directories for many examples of usage. (We suggest `examples/paex_saw.c` for an example.)

For information on compiling programs with PortAudio, please see the
