PortSentry is designed to detect and respond to port scans against a
target host in real-time.  Some of the more useful features include:

+ Runs on TCP and UDP sockets to detect port scans against your
system.  PortSentry is configurable to run on multiple sockets at the
same time so you only need to start one copy to cover dozens of
tripwired services.
+ PortSentry will react to a port scan attempt by blocking the host in
real-time.  This is done through configured options of either dropping
the local route back to the attacker, using the Linux ipfwadm/ipchains
command, *BSD ipfw command, and/or dropping the attacker host IP into
a TCP Wrappers hosts.deny file automatically.
+ PortSentry has an internal state engine to remember hosts that
connected previously.  This allows the setting of a trigger value to
prevent false alarms and detect "random" port probing.
+ PortSentry will report all violations to the local or remote syslog
daemons indicating the system name, time of attack, attacking host IP
and the TCP or UDP port a connection attempt was made to.  When used
in conjunction with Logcheck it will provide an alert to
administrators through e-mail.
+ Once a scan is detected your system will turn into a blackhole and
disappear from the attacker.  This feature stops most attacks cold.
