1) does it work on NetBSD systems?

2) add EULA to pkgsrc/licenses in case this package leaves -wip (?)

3) on FreeBSD-4-STABLE with 4.3.0 XFree86:

	Xlib:  extension "XiG-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD" missing on display ":0.0".
	GL_EXT_bgra not supported - bailing out.

   As I found out, this is quite known problem:
   
	http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-xfree86/2003-Sep/0001.html
	
   ... but I have no time to investigate / patch it now, sorry.
   
   It is said, that XiG-extension error can be ignored. The problem is the
   lack of GL_EXT_bgra .
   
4) is the libGL symlink a good hack or does Postal need other linux-base / newer
   GLX?
   
5) create a startup shell script

6) needs about 1 GB to extract/install from pkgsrc. Could we warn about it?
