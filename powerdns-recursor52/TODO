# $NetBSD$

Generally works
Require some tests where there is some load of DNS queries
Default config file applied which is not enabled by default
A lot of options enabled by default, maybe switch to options.mk?
Clean-up and better comments in files
Ensure that cargo is used correctly, little hacking was done to make it compile correctly
pdns_recursor.sh taken from old version present in pkgsrc with little update of config file
