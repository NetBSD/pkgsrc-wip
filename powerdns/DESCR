The PowerDNS nameserver is a modern, advanced and high performance
authoritative-only nameserver.  It is written from scratch and conforms
to all the relevant DNS standards documents.  PowerDNS is open source.

The PowerDNS nameserver utilizes a flexible backend architecture that
can access DNS information from any data source.  This includes file
formats, Bind zone files, relational databases or LDAP directories.

See the net/powerdns-* packages for additional backend modules.
