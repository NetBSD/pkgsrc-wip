PPR is a Unix print spooler expressly designed for operating
PostScript printers.

Its features are numerous, and it supports PostScript printers
connected to parallel or serial ports, or over the network through
AppleTalk, LanManager, LPD, and TCP/IP protocols. It accepts jobs from
SMB clients (such as Microsoft Windows), Macintosh, and Unix clients.

PPR is designed for PostScript printing, so it can detect PostScript
errors. If the input file is not PostScript, it can pipe the input
through a filter. PPR has been designed to manage large numbers of
printers with minimal operator attention.
