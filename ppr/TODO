# PPR is a print spooler for PostScript printers

Work-to-do in random order:

(1) Set up a working files/pprd.sh rc.d start script.

(2) Pick and install example config files.

(2a) Handle installation to /etc/ppr properly, including example files
in share/examples/ppr.

(2b) Do not install *.sample files.

(3) Fix PLIST. [DONE]

(4) Figure out how everything goes together and test.  :)

(5) Install ipp server (patch top-level Makefile to include ipp in
build) plus notify inetd.conf addition.

(6) Handle Samba, LaTeX etc. support by using bsd.options.mk

(7) During installation, ppr sets up filters by searching for a lot of
print- and graphics-relate dtools (LaTex, jpeg/png/tiff,
converters/filters). How to handle that pkgsrc-like?

(7a) Keep PPR from installing a crontab for user ppr. [DONE]

(7b) MESSAGE: Mention the crontab for ppr user during {,un}install.

(8) Resolve naming conflict between Netatalk papd and PPR papd.

(9) Decide on using the UPRINT script to move the native lp{,r} tools
out of the way.

(10) Make PPR install the man pages under {PREFIX}/man. [DONE]

(10a) Make sure the PRR install scripts don't remove anything essential...

(10b) Fix the crufty manpage install.

(11) There's a bogus bash call somewhere in the install make
target. Find it and root it out.

(12) Keep PPR from adding to /etc/services.

(13) - Sic! - Yes, I should have 'cvs import'ed the package. Sorry.
