- Edit the PRNGD configuration file ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/prngd.conf
   (see ${SHAREDIR}/doc/prngd). Until the conf file for NetBSD is 
   incorporated into the current or next PRNGD release, a sample conf file
   can be found at http://othyro.freeshell.org/prngd.conf

- Add entries to /etc/rc.local for PRNGD to start on system boot.

-- Regarding entropy gathering commands in prngd.conf:

The "rate" represents the number of bits of usuable entropy per byte of
command output. Adjust the rates as you see fit, but be conservative.

Depending on the usage of your system, some commands may not produce
output that varies significantly over time. Keep in mind the usage of
such commands will not produce considerably random data. Use commands
whose output will gather decent entropy.

- Please browse the manual and the PRNGD home page for more information.
