progsreiserfs is a library for reiserfs filesystem access and manipulation.
The primary goal is to develop a nice, full featured library which can be
linked against projects that need reiserfs filesystem access.  These are,
for example, GNU Parted, GNU GRUB, Yaboot, Partimage, EVMS, etc.

progsreiserfs supports versions 3.5 and 3.6, with standard and relocated
journal.
