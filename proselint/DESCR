proselint is a linter for prose. A linter is a computer program that, like a
spell checker, scans through a document and analyzes it.

proselint places the world's greatest writers and editors by your side, where
they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose. You'll be guided by
advice inspired by Bryan Garner, David Foster Wallace, Chuck Palahniuk, Steve
Pinker, Mary Norris, Mark Twain, Elmore Leonard, George Orwell, Matthew
Butterick, William Strunk, E.B. White, Philip Corbett, Ernest Gowers, and the
editorial staff of the world's finest literary magazines and newspapers, among
others. Our goal is to aggregate knowledge about best practices in writing and
to make that knowledge immediately accessible to all authors in the form of a
linter for prose.

proselint is a command-line utility that can be integrated into existing tools.
