ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions
in DYNAMICALLY LINKED programs via a preloaded DLL (dlsym(), LD_PRELOAD)
and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.
It supports TCP only (no UDP/ICMP etc).

The way it works is basically a HACK; so it is possible that it doesn't
work with your program, especially when it's a script, or starts
numerous processes like background daemons or uses dlopen() to load
"modules" (bug in glibc dynlinker).
It should work with simple compiled (C/C++) dynamically linked programs
though.

Quick Facts:
 * It's a proxifier.
 * Dedicated OS: Linux/BSD/Solaris.
 * Intercepts and hooks TCP calls made by any given Internet client.
 * Allows remote TCP tunneling through proxies.
 * Supports HTTP-CONNECT, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy servers.
 * Different proxy types can be mixed in the same chain.
 * Proxy chain: user-defined list of proxies chained together.
