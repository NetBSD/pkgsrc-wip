ProZilla is a multi-threaded download accelerator for Linux
which supports both HTTP and FTP protocols. It makes multiple
connections to the server and downloads the file in portions,
thus giving a much better speed rate than the conventional
download programs which use a single connection. Resuming
connections is fully supported and customizable.The new FTPSearch
feature enables retrieving of mirrors, and also pings them to
select the fastest server available. Both the number of mirrors
to retrieve and the number of servers to ping at once are fully customizable.
