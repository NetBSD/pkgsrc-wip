ProZilla is a multi-threaded download accelerator for Linux 
which supports both HTTP and FTP protocols. It makes multiple 
connections to the server and downloads the file in portions, 
thus giving a much better speed rate than the conventional 
download programs which use a single connection. Resuming 
connections is fully supported and customizable.The new FTPSearch 
feature enables retrieving of mirrors, and also pings them to 
select the fastest server available. Both the number of mirrors 
to retrieve and the number of servers to ping at once are fully customizable.
