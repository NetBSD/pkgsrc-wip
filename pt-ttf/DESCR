PT Family was developed as a part of the project "Public Types
of Russian Federation". The fonts of this project have open user
license and can be freely distributed. The main aim of the project
is to give possibility to the peoples of Russia to read and write
on their native languages. The project is dedicated to 300-year
anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708-1710
years and was realized with financial support from Federal Agency
for Press and Mass Communications.

The fonts beside standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic
code pages contain characters of all title languages of Russian
Federation that make them unique and very important tool of the
modern digital communications.
