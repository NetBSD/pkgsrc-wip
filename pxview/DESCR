pxview is a small command line program which uses pxlib.

pxlib is a simply and still small C library to read Paradox DB files. It
supports all versions starting from 3.0. It currently has a very limited set
of functions like to open a DB file, read its header and read every single
record. It can also extract blob data and write it to a file.
