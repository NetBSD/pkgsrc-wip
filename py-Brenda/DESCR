PyBrenda is a system for easily doing parallel computation using the
Python programming language.  It is somewhat similar to the C-Linda
language; it uses the notion of "tuple space" to simplify the
interactions among processes.

PyBrenda coordinates requests for more processors to be involved in
computations and facilitates data sharing among those processors.
