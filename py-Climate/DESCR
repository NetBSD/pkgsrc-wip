PyClimate is a Python package designed to accomplish some usual tasks needed
during the analysis of climate variability. It provides functions to handle
simple I/O operations, handling of COARDS-compliante netCDF files, EOF analysis,
SVD and CCA analysis of coupled data sets, some linear digital filters, kernel
based probability density function estimation and access to DCDFLIB.C library
from Python.
