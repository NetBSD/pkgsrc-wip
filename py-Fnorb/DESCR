Fnorb is a CORBA 2.0 ORB for Python first developed by DSTC. Fnorb's claim
to fame is its size and pure Python implementation. These features allow it
to be used whever Python may used (for example, within Jython) unlike other
ORBs that rely on binary runtimes.

Unfortunately Fnorb development fell behind other ORBs as research
priorities changed at DSTC. Now that it has been open sourced our project
aims to take the formerly closed Fnorb source-base and turn it into a pure
Python ORB with up-to-date Python mapping and CORBA compliance (including
POA support and the latest data-types).
