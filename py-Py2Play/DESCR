Py2Play is a network game engine written in Python, and it rests on a Peer
To Peer model (ala Napster) and not a client-server one, as it is usually
done.

Peer To Peer presents some avantages, and drawbacks too, which will be
detailed in a future article on this subject (let me the time to write it !).

Py2Play can be used for about any game, even if it has been designed at the
origin with massive online games in mind. It interfaces well with Soya3D but
can be used separately too. The only limitation is that each player must
play a single character.
