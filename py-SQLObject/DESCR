SQLObject is an object-relational mapper. It allows you to translate RDBMS
table rows into Python objects, and manipulate those objects to
transparently manipulate the database.

In using SQLObject, you will create a class definition that will describe
how the object connects to the database (in addition to any other methods
you may wish to add to the class). SQLObject will produce the code to access
the database, and update the database with your changes. The interface to
the database is meant to be indistinguishable from other interfaces you may
add to the object.

SQLObject also includes a novel feature to generate WHERE clauses using
Python syntax and objects (intead of generating SQL using string
substitution, as is traditional).
