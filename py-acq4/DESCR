ACQ4 is a python-based platform for experimental neurophysiology.
It includes support for standard electrophysiology, multiphoton imaging,
scanning laser photostimulation, and many other experimental techniques. ACQ4 is
highly modular and extensible, allowing support to be added for new types of
devices, techniques, user-interface modules, and analyses
