Albatross is a small and flexible toolkit for developing highly stateful web
applications. The toolkit provides the following:
* Browser based sessions via automatically generated hidden form fields
  (cryptographically signed to ensure integrity).
* Server side sessions via a session server or file based session store.
* Powerful and extensible templating system which promotes separation of
  presentation and implementation for improved program maintainability.
* Pagination of sequences and tree browsing are handled implicitly in the
  templating system.
* Macros allow repeated HTML and special effects HTML to be defined in one
  location.
* Lookup tables translate internal program values to arbitrary template code.
* Applications can be deployed as either CGI programs or as mod_python module
  with minor changes to program mainline. Custom deployment can be achieved
  by developing your own Request class.
* Highly modular application framework which is flexible and extensible which
  allows many different application construction models. Eight Application
  classes are provided while many more are possible.
* Comprehensive documentation including many installable samples.

A primary design goal of Albatross is that it be small and easy to use and
extend. Most of the toolkit is constructed from a collection of mixin classes.
You are encouraged to look at the code and to think of new ways to combine the
Albatross mixin classes with your own classes.
