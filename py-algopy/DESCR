ALGOPY is a tool for Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Taylor polynomial
approximations. ALGOPY makes it possible to perform computations on scalar
and polynomial matrices. It is designed to be as compatible to numpy as
possible. I.e. views, broadcasting and most functions of numpy can be performed
on polynomial matrices. Exampels are dot,trace,qr,solve, inv,eigh. The reverse
mode of AD is also supported by a simple code evaluation tracer
