ApplPy is a computational probability package written in Python.
The project runs using the open source SymPy computer algebra system
(CAS). Because all of the dependencies that ApplPy requires to run are
open source, ApplPy is available free of charge. While still incomplete,
ApplPy will eventually be capable of performing a wide range of random
variable algebra operations on univariate probaility distributions
