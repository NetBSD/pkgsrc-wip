argparse: Python command line parser

The argparse module provides an easy, declarative interface for creating
command line tools, which knows how to:

    * parse the arguments and flags from sys.argv
    * convert arg strings into objects for your program
    * format and print informative help messages
    * and much more...

The argparse module improves on the standard library optparse module in a number
of ways including:

    * handling positional arguments
    * supporting sub-commands
    * allowing alternative option prefixes like + and /
    * handling zero-or-more and one-or-more style arguments
    * producing more informative usage messages
    * providing a much simpler interface for custom types and actions
