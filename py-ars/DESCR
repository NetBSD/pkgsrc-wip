ARS is a physically-accurate robotics simulator written in Python.
It's main purpose is to help researchers to develop mobile
manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
is open-source, modular, easy to learn and use,
and can be a valuable tool in the process
of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
well as in teaching and educational activities
