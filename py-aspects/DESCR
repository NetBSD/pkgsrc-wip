Aaspects is a lightweight and low-level library for intercepting function
calls. Functions and methods (also in Python standard library and third
party code) can be wrapped so that when they are called, the wrap is invoked
first. Depending on the wrap, the execution of the original function can be
omitted, or the function can be called arbitrarily many times. Wraps are
able to modify the call arguments and the return values of wrapped functions
and handle exceptions. There can be many wraps on the same function. The
wraps can be enabled, disabled and removed in any order. In the terminology
of aspect-oriented programming, the library allows applying advices (wraps)
to call join points of methods and functions in around fashion
