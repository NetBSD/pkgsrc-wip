Aspects.py is a lightweight approach to aspect oriented programming (AOP) in
Python. Aspects.py is a lightweight and low-level library for intercepting
function calls. Functions and methods (also in Python standard library and third
party code) can be wrapped so that when they are called, the wrap is invoked
first. Depending on the wrap, the execution of the original function can be
omitted, or the function can be called arbitrarily many times. Wraps are able to
modify the call arguments and the return values of wrapped functions and handle
exceptions. There can be many wraps on the same function. The wraps can be
enabled, disabled and removed in any order In the terminology of aspect-oriented
programming, the library allows applying advices (wraps) to call join points of
methods and functions in around fashion.
