This package contains the asyncore module as found in Python versions
prior to 3.12. It is provided so that existing code relying on
import asyncore is able to continue being used without significant
refactoring.

The module's source code is taken directly from the Python standard
library. The specific version of asyncore that is provided is the
last update before the addition of deprecation/removal warnings at
import time, and is essentially equivalent to the version bundled
with Python 3.9 (which was the last time the module was meaningfully
updated).

Please note that new projects should prefer asyncio.
