# Azure Storage Blobs client library for Python
Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

Blob storage is ideal for:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser
* Storing files for distributed access
* Streaming video and audio
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service
