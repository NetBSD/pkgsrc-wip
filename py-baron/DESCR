Baron is a Full Syntax Tree (FST) library for Python. By opposition to
an `AST <https: en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" abstract_syntax_tree="">`__ which
drops some syntax information in the process of its creation (like empty
lines, comments, formatting), a FST keeps everything and guarantees the
operation fst\_to\_code(code\_to\_fst(source\_code)) == source\_code.
