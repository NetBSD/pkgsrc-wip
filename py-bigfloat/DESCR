The bigfloat package is a Python package providing arbitrary-precision
correctly-rounded binary floating-point arithmetic. Features:

 * correct rounding on all operations; precisely defined semantics compatible
   with the IEEE 754-2008 standard.
 * support for mixed-type operations with Python integers and floats
 * support for emulating IEEE 754 arithmetic in any of the IEEE binary
   interchange formats described in IEEE 754-2008. Infinities, NaNs, signed
   zeros, and subnormals are all supported.
 * easy control of rounding modes and precisions, via Python's 'with' statement.
