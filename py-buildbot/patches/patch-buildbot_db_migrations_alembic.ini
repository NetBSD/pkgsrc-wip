+# path_separator; This indicates what character is used to split lists of file
+# paths, including version_locations and prepend_sys_path within configparser
+# files such as alembic.ini.
+# The default rendered in new alembic.ini files is "os", which uses os.pathsep
+# to provide os-dependent path splitting.
+#
+# Note that in order to support legacy alembic.ini files, this default does NOT
+# take place if path_separator is not present in alembic.ini.  If this
+# option is omitted entirely, fallback logic is as follows:
+#
+# 1. Parsing of the version_locations option falls back to using the legacy
+#    "version_path_separator" key, which if absent then falls back to the legacy
+#    behavior of splitting on spaces and/or commas.
+# 2. Parsing of the prepend_sys_path option falls back to the legacy
+#    behavior of splitting on spaces, commas, or colons.
+#
+# Valid values for path_separator are:
+#
+# path_separator = :
+# path_separator = ;
+# path_separator = space
+# path_separator = newline

+# Use os.pathsep. Default configuration used for new projects.
