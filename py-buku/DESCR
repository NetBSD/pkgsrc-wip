buku is a powerful bookmark manager and a personal textual mini-web.

For those who prefer the GUI, bukuserver exposes a browsable
front-end on a local web host server. See bukuserver page for config
and screenshots.

buku can import bookmarks from browser(s) or fetch the title, tags
and description of a URL from the web. Use your favourite editor
to add, compose and update bookmarks. Search bookmarks instantly
with multiple search options, including regex and a deep scan mode
(handy with URLs).

It can look up broken links on the Wayback Machine. There's an
Easter Egg to revisit random bookmarks.

There's no tracking, hidden history, obsolete records, usage
analytics or homing.
