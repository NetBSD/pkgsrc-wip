Cloud Custodian, also known as c7n, is a rules engine for managing public
cloud accounts and resources. It allows users to define policies to enable
a well managed cloud infrastructure, that's both secure and cost optimized.
It consolidates many of the adhoc scripts organizations have into a
lightweight and flexible tool, with unified metrics and reporting.

Custodian can be used to manage AWS, Azure, and GCP environments by
ensuring real time compliance to security policies (like encryption and
access requirements), tag policies, and cost management via garbage
collection of unused resources and off-hours resource management.

Custodian also supports running policies on infrastructure as code
assets to provide feedback directly on developer workstations or within
CI pipelines.

Custodian policies are written in simple YAML configuration files that
enable users to specify policies on a resource type (EC2, ASG,
Redshift, CosmosDB, PubSub Topic) and are constructed from a vocabulary
of filters and actions.

It integrates with the cloud native serverless capabilities of each
provider to provide for real time enforcement of policies with builtin
provisioning. Or it can be run as a simple cron job on a server to
execute against large existing fleets.
