Cantera is an open-source collection of object-oriented software tools for
problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
Among other things, it can be used to:

    Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
    Compute chemical equilibrium
    Evaluate species chemical production rates
    Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
    Simulate one-dimensional flames
    Conduct reaction path analysis
    Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
    Model non-ideal fluids
