Following warning may be handled by building sundials with blas/lapack

- WARNING: External BLAS/LAPACK has been specified for Cantera but SUNDIALS was built without this support. Cantera will use the slower default solver implementations included with SUNDIALS. You can resolve this warning by installing or building SUNDIALS with BLAS/LAPACK support.

ccache is not getting used - how to tell scons to use one?

Should we be passing buildlink here?

	SCONS_BUILD_ARGS+=      sundials_include=${PREFIX}/include
	SCONS_BUILD_ARGS+=      sundials_libdir=${PREFIX}/lib

${PYSITELIB}/cantera/data and share/cantera/data appear to have duplicated yaml files. Wonder if we can trim them out from ${PYSITELIB}
