causalinfo is a Python library to aid in experimenting with different
information measures on causal graphsâ€”a combination of information theory
with recent work on causal graphs [Pearl2000]. These information measures
can used to ascertain the degree to which one variable controls or explains
other variables in the graph. The use of these measures has important
connections to work on causal explanation in philosophy of science, and to
understanding information processing in biological networks
