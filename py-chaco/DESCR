Chaco is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writing plotting
applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with hard-coded
data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships and a
multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static plots
for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive
data visualization and exploration.
