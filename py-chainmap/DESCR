This module is a polyfill, implementing ChainMap for reasonably-recent versions
of Python that do not have collections.ChainMap-namely, Python 2.6, Python
3.2, and PyPy3 releases based on Python 3.2. (It will also work as expected on
Python 2.7, PyPy, and Python 3.3+, but it is not strictly needed there since
those versions' collections modules contains good ChainMap implementations.)
