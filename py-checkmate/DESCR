CheckMATE (Check Models At Terascale Energies) is a program package which
accepts simulated event files in many formats for any given model.
The program then determines whether the model is excluded or not at 95% C.L.
by comparing to many recent experimental analyses. Furthermore the program
can calculate confidence limits and provide detailed information about signal
regions of interest. It is simple to use and the program structure allows for
easy extensions to upcoming LHC results in the future.
