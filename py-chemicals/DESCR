The chemicals library features an extensive compilation of pure component
chemical data that can serve engineers, scientists, technicians, and anyone
working with chemicals. The chemicals library facilitates the retrieval and
calculation of:

    Chemical constants including formula, molecular weight, normal boiling and
melting points, triple point, heat of formation, absolute entropy of formation,
heat of fusion, similarity variable, dipole moment, acentric factor, etc.

    Assorted information of safety and toxicity of chemicals.

    Methods (and their respective coefficients) for the calculation of
temperature and pressure dependent chemical properties including vapor
pressure, heat capacity, molar volume, thermal conductivity, surface tension,
dynamic viscosity, heat of vaporization, relative permittivity, etc.

    Methods to solve thermodynamic phase equilibrium, including flash routines,
vapor-liquid equilibrium constant correlations, and both numerical and
analytical solutions for the Rachford Rice and Li-Johns-Ahmadi equations.
Rashford Rice solutions for systems of 3 or more phases are also available.
