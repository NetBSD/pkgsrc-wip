PyCM is a multi-class confusion matrix library written in Python
that supports both input data vectors and direct matrix, and a
proper tool for post-classification model evaluation that supports
most classes and overall statistics parameters. PyCM is the swiss-army
knife of confusion matrices, targeted mainly at data scientists that
need a broad array of metrics for predictive models and accurate
evaluation of a large variety of classifiers.
