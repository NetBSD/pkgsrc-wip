COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely
used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. COBRApy is a constraint-based modeling package that is
designed to accomodate the biological complexity of the next generation
of COBRA models and provides access to commonly used COBRA methods,
such as flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and
gene deletion analyses
