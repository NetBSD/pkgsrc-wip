A framework for building 2D games, demos, and other graphical/interactive
applications. Draws using OpenGL, which is hardware accelerated.
It provides some conventions and classes to help you structure a
"scene based application"

A cocos2d application consists of several scenes, and a workflow connecting
the different scenes It provides you with a "director" (a singleton) which
handles that workflow between scenes. Each scene is composed of an arbitrary
number of layers;
layers take care of drawing to the screen (using the pyglet and OpenGL APIs),
handling events and in general contain all of the game/application logic.
