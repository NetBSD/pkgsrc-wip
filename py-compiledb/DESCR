Tool for generating Clang's JSON Compilation Database file for GNU
`make`-based build systems.

It's aimed mainly at non-cmake (cmake already generates compilation
database) large codebases. Inspired by projects like YCM-Generator
and Bear, but faster (mainly with large projects), since in most
cases it doesn't need a clean build (as the mentioned tools do) to
generate the compilation database file, to achieve this it uses
the make options such as `-n`/`--dry-run` and `-k`/`--keep-going`
to extract the compile commands. Also, it's more **cross-compiling
friendly** than YCM-generator's fake-toolchain approach.
