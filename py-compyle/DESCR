Compyle allows users to execute a restricted subset of Python
(almost similar to C) on a variety of HPC platforms. Currently
we support multi-core CPU execution using Cython, and for GPU
devices we use OpenCL or CUDA.

Users start with code implemented in a very restricted Python
syntax, this code is then automatically transpiled, compiled
and executed to run on either one CPU core, or multiple CPU
cores (via OpenMP) or on a GPU. Compyle offers source-to-source
transpilation, making it a very convenient tool for writing HPC
libraries.

Some simple yet powerful parallel utilities are provided which
can allow you to solve a remarkably large number of interesting
HPC problems. Compyle also features JIT transpilation making
it easy to us
