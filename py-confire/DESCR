Confire is a simple but powerful configuration scheme that builds on the
configuration parsers of Scapy, elasticsearch, Django and others. The basic
scheme is to have a configuration search path that looks for YAML files in
standard locations. The search path is hierarchical (meaning that system
configurations are overloaded by user configurations, etc). These YAML
files are then added to a default, class-based configuration management
scheme that allows for easy development
