The PyCSP project is an on-going project to bring CSP (communicating sequential
processes) to Python.

PyCSP Provides:

 * A flexible CSP library for Python;
 * Synchronous communication;
 * Buffered channels;
 * Multiple process types such as, greenlets, threads, processes and remote
   processes;
 * Both input and output guards supported in external choice (Alts);
 * A single any-to-any channel type;
 * Mobile channel-ends;
 * Retire and poison signals for shutting down networks nicely;
 * A channel which can communicate using inter-process communication as well as
   sockets;
 * A PyCSP providing local and distributed communication using only standard
   python modules bundled with CPython;
 * NAT traversal;
 * Tracing PyCSP executions to a log file, for later visualisation;

This is the "complete" version of PyCSP as opposed to the "base" version.
