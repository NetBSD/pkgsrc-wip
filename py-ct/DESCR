Makes various commands available to other packages
. (Currently no sophisticated plugin system, just a try
import/except in the other packages.) The same commands are
available from within python. Can either add new subcommands to
an existing argparse based command if the module has an existing
command, or create the entire command if the module has no
existing command. Currently, there are commands for copying
examples and fetching data.
