The cva library (pronounced see-va) implements a solver for problems
in the domain of the calculus of variations. This includes such
problems as finding geodesics on arbitrary surfaces, finding minimal
paths in curved spacetime, or basically any path minimization problem
that can be defined in terms of a surface or hypersurface model with an
attached metric
