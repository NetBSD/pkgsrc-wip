This package is a stop-gap for cython-dependent packages incompatible
with cython 3.0.x.  It should be removed as soon as all dependent
packages can be migrated to 3.0.x.

The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language
as easy as Python itself. Cython is a source code translator based on
the well-known Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge functionality and
optimizations.

The Cython language is very close to the Python language (and most
Python code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally
supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and
class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient
C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for
external C libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the
execution of Python code.
