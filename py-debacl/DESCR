DeBaCl is a Python library for estimation of density level set trees and
nonparametric density-based clustering. Level set trees are based on the
statistically-principled definition of clusters as modes of a probability
density function. They are particularly useful for analyzing structure in
complex datasets that exhibit multi-scale clustering behavior
DeBaCl is intended to promote the practical use of level set trees through
improvements in computational efficiency, flexible algorithms, and an emphasis
on modularity and user customizability
