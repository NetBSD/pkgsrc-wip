diffeqpy is a package for solving differential equations in Python. It 
utilizes DifferentialEquations.jl for its core routines to give high 
performance solving of many different types of differential equations, 
including:

    Discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/
    Markov) simulations)
    Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
    Split and Partitioned ODEs (Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods)
    Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs)
    Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs)
    Differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
    Delay differential equations (DDEs)
    Mixed discrete and continuous equations (Hybrid Equations, Jump 
    Diffusions)

directly in Python
