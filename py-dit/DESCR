dit implements a vast range of multivariate information measures in
an effort to allow information practitioners to study how these
various measures behave and interact in a variety of contexts.
We hope that having all these measures and techniques implemented
in one place will allow the development of robust techniques for
the automated quantification of dependencies within a system and
concrete interpretation of what those dependencies mean.
