Axiom is an object database, or alternatively, an object-relational mapper. Its
primary goal is to provide an object-oriented layer with what we consider to be
the key aspects of OO, i.e. polymorphism and message dispatch, without
hindering the power of an RDBMS. It is designed to "feel pythonic", without
encouraging the typical ORM behavior such as potato programming.
