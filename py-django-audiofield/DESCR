Django-audiofield is a Django application which allows audio file upload and
conversion to mp3, wav and ogg format. It also makes it easy to play the audio
files into your django application, for this we integrated a HTML5 and Flash
audio player 'SoundManager2'

The goal of this project is to quickly manage audio files into your django project and
make it easy for admins and users to listen to them.
