A library to encode/decode DNS wire-format packets supporting both
Python 2.7 and Python 3.2+.

The library provides:

 * Support for encoding/decoding DNS packets between wire format,
   python objects, and Zone/DiG textual representation (dnslib.dns)
 * A server framework allowing the simple creation of custom DNS
   resolvers (dnslib.server) and a number of example servers
   created using this framework
 * A number of utilities for testing (dnslib.client, dnslib.proxy,
   dnslib.intercept)
