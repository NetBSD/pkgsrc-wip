The purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by the graph layout tool
Graphviz, a more LaTeX friendly look and feel. This is accomplished by:

- Using native PSTricks_ and PGF/TikZ commands for drawing arrows,
  edges and nodes.
- Typesetting labels with LaTeX, allowing mathematical notation.
- Using backend specific styles to customize the output.
