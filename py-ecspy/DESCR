ECsPy (Evolutionary Computations in Python) is a free, open source framework
for creating evolutionary computations in Python. Additionally, ECsPy provides
an easy-to-use canonical genetic algorithm (GA), evolution strategy (ES),
estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), differential evolution algorithm
(DEA), and particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for users who don't need much
customization.

As of April 3, 2012, ECsPy has been deprecated. New users should instead use
the inspyred library. ECsPy will no longer be maintained.
