eggnog-mapper is a tool for fast functional annotation of novel sequences
(genes or proteins) using precomputed eggNOG-based orthology assignments.
Obvious examples include the annotation of novel genomes, transcriptomes or
even metagenomic gene catalogs. The use of orthology predictions for functional
annotation is considered more precise than traditional homology searches, as it
avoids transferring annotations from paralogs (duplicate genes with a higher
chance of being involved in functional divergence).
