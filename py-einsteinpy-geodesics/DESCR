EinsteinPy Geodesics is an addon package for EinsteinPy, that wraps
over Julia's excellent DifferentialEquations.jl suite and provides
a python interface to solve for geodesics in Kerr & Schwarzschild
spacetime. EinsteinPy is an open source pure Python package,
dedicated to problems arising in General Relativity and Gravitational Physics
