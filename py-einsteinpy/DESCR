EinsteinPy is an open source pure Python package dedicated to problems arising
in General Relativity and gravitational physics, such as geodesics plotting
for Schwarzschild, Kerr and Kerr Newman space-time model, calculation of
Schwarzschild radius, calculation of Event Horizon and Ergosphere for Kerr
space-time. Symbolic Manipulations of various tensors like Metric, Riemann,
Ricci, Ricci Scalar, Weyl, Schouten, Stress-Energy-Momentum, Einstein and
Christoffel Symbols is also possible using the library. EinsteinPy also
features Hypersurface Embedding of Schwarzschild space-time, which will
soon lead to modelling of Gravitational Lensing!.
