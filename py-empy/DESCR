EMpy (not to be confused with Empy) is a suite of numerical algorithms widely
used in electromagnetism The package contains:

    * an isotropic and anisotropic transfer matrix algorithm;
    * an isotropic and anisotropic rigorous coupled wave analysis
       (RCWA) algorithm;
    * the numerical model of the frequency response of different well-known
       devices (Mach-Zehnder, Ring Resonators, etc.)
