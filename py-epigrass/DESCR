Epigrass is a software for visualizing, analyzing and simulating of
epidemic processes on geo-referenced networks

EpiGrass can interact with the GRASS GIS from which it can obtain maps and other
geo-referenced information. However, EpiGrass does not require an installation
of the GRASS GIS for most of its features.
