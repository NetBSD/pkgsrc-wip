This module provides a python API to interact with an EteSync server.
It currently implements AddressBook and Calendar access, and supports two-way
sync (both push and pull) to the server.
It doesn't currently implement pushing raw journal entries which are needed for
people implementing new EteSync journal types which will be implemented soon.
