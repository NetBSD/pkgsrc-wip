FermiLib is an open source effort for compiling and analyzing
quantum simulation algorithms.

The current version is an alpha release which features data structures
and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic
Hamiltonians. FermiLib is designed as a library on top of ProjectQ
and leverages ProjectQ to compile, emulate and simulate quantum
circuits. There are also plugins available for FermiLib.

You may also be interested in OpenFermion, an actively developed
FermiLib fork which is designed without an explicit dependency
on ProjectQ in order to support a variety of circuit compilation
and simulation frameworks
