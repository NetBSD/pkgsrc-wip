firehose is a Python package intended for managing the results
from code analysis tools (e.g. compiler warnings, static analysis,
linters, etc).

It currently provides parsers for the output of gcc, clang-analyzer,
cppcheck, and findbugs. These parsers convert the results into a
common data model of Python objects, with methods for lossless
roundtrips through a provided XML format. There is also a JSON
equivalent.
