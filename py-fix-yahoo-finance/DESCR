fix-yahoo-finance offers a temporary fix to the problem by scraping
the data from Yahoo! finance using and return a Pandas DataFrame/Panel
in the same format as pandas_datareader's get_data_yahoo().

By basically "hijacking" pandas_datareader.data.get_data_yahoo()
method, fix-yahoo-finance's implantation is easy and only requires to
import fix_yahoo_finance into your code.
