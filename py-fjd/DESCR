fjd makes it easy to run computational jobs on many CPUs.

There are several powerful tools for automatic distribution of computational
jobs. However, for smaller use cases, the effort of installation and setup is
too high

With fjd, the hurdle to get started is very low. Installation is easy. Pushing
jobs into the queue only requires writing small and simple files. Per default,
all CPUs on your computer are used. New computers can be added very easily,
too. Plus, your jobs can be written in any language.

fjd works under the assumption that all CPUs are in a local network and can
access a shared home directory.
