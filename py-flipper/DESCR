Flipper is a program for computing the action of mapping classes on
laminations on punctured surfaces using ideal triangulation coordinates
It can decide the Nielsen-Thurston type of a given mapping class and,
for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, construct a layered, veering
triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol
