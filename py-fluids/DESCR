fluids is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical, mechanical, or civil engineering. It includes modules for
piping, fittings, pumps, tanks, compressible flow, open-channel flow, and more.

The fluids library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality.
