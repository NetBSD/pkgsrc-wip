pyFormex is a program for generating, transforming and manipulating large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical operations.
Thanks to a powerful (Python based) scripting language, pyFormex is very well
suited for the automated design of spatial frame structures. It provides a wide
range of operations on surface meshes, like STL type triangulated surfaces.
There are provisions to import medical scan images. pyFormex can also be used
as a pre- and post-processor for Finite  Element analysis programs. Finally,
it might be used just for creating some nice graphics. Using pyFormex,
the topology of the elements and the final geometrical form can be decoupled.
Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto the geometry. Through the
scripting language, the user can define any sequence of transformations, built
from provided or user defined functions. This way, building parametric models
becomes a natural thing
