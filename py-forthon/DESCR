Forthon provides an extensive wrapping of Fortran95 code, giving access to
routines and to any data in Fortran modules. Forthon also
provides an extensive wrapping of Fortran derived types, giving access to
derived type members, allowing passing of derived types into Fortran routines,
and creation of instances at the Python level. A mechanism for automatic
building of extension modules is also included. Versions using Numeric and
Numpy are available
