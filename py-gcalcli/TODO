gcalcli init seems to fails with:

 RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
 [...]
 OSError: Failed to fetch credentials. If this is a nonstandard gcalcli install, please try again with a system-installed gcalcli as a workaround.
 Details: https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli/issues/735.

No idea if this is an upstream issue or not.
