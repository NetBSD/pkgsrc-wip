The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in
python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely,
providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface
to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do
operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database
such as PostGIS
