geppy is built on top of the excellent evolutionary computation framework
DEAP for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas with GEP. DEAP provides
fundamental support for GP, while lacking support for GEP. geppy tries
the best to follow the style of DEAP and attempts to maintain compatibility
with the major infrastructure of DEAP. In other words, to some degree
geppy may be considered as a plugin of DEAP to specially support GEP.
If you are familiar with DEAP, then it is easy to grasp geppy. Besides,
comprehensive documentation is also available
