GerryChain is a Python library for building ensembles of districting
plans using Markov chain Monte Carlo. It is developed and maintained
by the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group and our network of
volunteers.

The basic workflow is to start with the geometry of an initial plan
and generate a large collection of sample plans for comparison.
Usually, we will constrain these sampled plans in such a way that
they perform at least as well as the initial plan according to
traditional districting principles, such as population balance or
compactness. Comparing the initial plan to the ensemble provides
quantitative tools for measuring whether or not it is an outlier
among the sampled plans
