Gist is a scientific graphics library written by David H. Munro of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. It features support for three common
graphics output devices: X-Windows, (Color) PostScript, and ANSI/ISO
Standard Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM). The library is small
(written directly to Xlib), portable, efficient, and full-featured. It
produces x-vs-y plots with ``good'' tick marks and tick labels,
2-D quadrilateral mesh plots with contours, vector fields, or pseudocolor
maps on such meshes, and a selection of 3-D plots.

The Python Gist module utilizes the ``Numerical'' package due to
J. Hugunin and others.  It is therefore fast and able to handle large
datasets. The Gist module includes an X-windows event dispatcher which
can be dynamically added to the Python interpreter. This makes fast
mouse-controlled zoom, pan, and other graphic operations available to
the researcher while maintaining the usual Python command-line interface.
