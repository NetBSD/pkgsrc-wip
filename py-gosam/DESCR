The package GoSam allows for the automated calculation of one-loop
amplitudes for multi-particle processes in renormalizable quantum
field theories. The amplitudes, which are generated in terms of Feynman
diagrams, can be reduced using either D-dimensional integrand-level
decomposition or by tensor reduction. GoSam can be used to calculate
one-loop QCD and/or electroweak corrections to Standard Model processes
and offers the flexibility to link model files for theories Beyond the
Standard Model. A standard interface (BLHA1, BLHA2) to programs
calculating real radiation is also implemented.
