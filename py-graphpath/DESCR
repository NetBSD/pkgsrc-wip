A little-language for analysing RDF, the syntax of the GraphPath is reminiscent
of Xpath The graphpath package provides a query evaluator and a
goal-driven inference engine for this language, which work together to perform
graph analysis. The package can be teamed up with your favourite python RDF API
(e.g. Redland, rdflib, or your own API).
