GratTeLPy (Graph Theoretic Analysis of Linear Stability) is a software tool for
parameter-free, graph-theoretic linear stability analysis. Given a mechanism
file that describes a chemical reaction network (CRN) of mass-action reactions,
GraTelPy analyzes the provided mechanism and determines if it meets a necessary
condition for multistability
