This package provides tools for creating and manipulating
Gaussian random variables from correlated multi-dimensional
Gaussian distributions. The Gaussian variables are represented
by objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar` which can be combined
with each other and with ordinary numbers in arbitrary
arithmetic expressions, including standard functions such
``sin`` and ``exp``, to create new :class:`gvar.GVar`\s whose
correlations with the original variables are tracked implicitly
(and handled correctly).

This package relies on ``numpy`` for efficient array arithmetic,
and on Cython to compile efficient core routines and interface code
