GWSurrogate is an easy to use interface to gravitational wave surrogate models
Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational
waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential
equations. These equations must be solved in the ``building" phase, which
was performed using other codes
