hal-cgp is an extensible pure Python library implementing Cartesian
genetic programming to represent, mutate and evaluate populations of
individuals encoding symbolic expressions targeting applications with
computationally expensive fitness evaluations. It supports the translation
from a CGP genotype, a two-dimensional Cartesian graph, into the
corresponding phenotype, a computational graph implementing a particular
mathematical expression
