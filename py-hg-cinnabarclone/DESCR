"cinnabarclone" is a mercurial server-side extension used to advertise
the existence of pre-generated, externally hosted git repository or
bundle providing git-cinnabar metadata corresponding to the mercurial
repository.  Cloning from such a git repository can be faster than
cloning from mercurial directly.
