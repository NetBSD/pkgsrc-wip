This is the Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial, adding the ability to push
and pull to/from a Git server repository from Hg.  This means you can
collaborate on Git based projects from Hg, or use a Git server as a
collaboration point for a team with developers using both Git and Hg.

The Hg-Git plugin can convert commits/changesets losslessly from one
system to another, so you can push via an Hg repository and another Hg
client can pull it and their changeset node ids will be identical -
Mercurial data does not get lost in translation.  It is intended that
Hg users may wish to use this to collaborate even if no Git users are
involved in the project, and it may even provide some advantages if
you're using Bookmarks.
