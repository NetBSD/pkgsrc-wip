hgapi is a pure-Python API to Mercurial, that uses the command-line
interface instead of the internal Mercurial API. The rationale for
this is twofold: the internal API is unstable, and it is GPL.

hgapi works for any version of Mercurial, including  < 1.9, and will
instantly reflect any changes to the repository. It also has a really
permissive license (do whatever you want, don't blame me).

For example of code that uses this API, take a look at
https://bitbucket.org/haard/autohook which now uses hgapi
exclusively
