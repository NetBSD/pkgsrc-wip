pyicane is a Python wrapper for the Statistical Office of Cantabriaas (ICANE)
metadata restful API. This module parses ICANEas json data and metadata into
Python objects and common data structures such as Pandas dataframes [1].
All ICANEas API classes and methods are covered; also, time-series data
can be downloaded into a Python Pandas dataframe structure.
