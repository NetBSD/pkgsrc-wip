Faster zlib and gzip compatible compression and decompression by
providing Python bindings for the ISA-L library.

This package provides Python bindings for the ISA-L library. The
Intel(R) Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L) implements
several key algorithms in assembly language. This includes a variety
of functions to provide zlib/gzip-compatible compression.
