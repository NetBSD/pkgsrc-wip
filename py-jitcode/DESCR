JiTCODE stands for just-in-time compilation for ordinary differential equations
and is an extension of SciPy's ODE (scipy.integrate.ode). Where SciPy's ODE
takes a Python function a7s an argument, JiTCODE takes an iterable (or generator
function) of SymPy terms, which it translates to C code, compiles on the fly,
and uses as the function to feed into SciPy's ODE. This can result in a
considerable speed boost, making the integration en par with purely compiled
programs for large differential equations
