PyKCS11 let you access to almost all PKCS#11 functions and data types
using any PKCS#11 library, such as the various modules supplied by
smartcard vendors
The wrapper comes with 2 interfaces: a low level and very thin
interface over the original PKCS#11 API, generated using the SWIG compiler
(designed for library tests); and an high level interface that
offers a simpler access (with few limits) to the PKCS#11 APIs.
