Lea is a Python package aiming at working with discrete probability
distributions in an intuitive way. It allows you to model a broad range of
random phenomenons, like dice throwing, coin tossing, cards hands, gambling,
lottery, ? with fair or unfair characteristics More generally, Lea may be used
for any finite set of discrete values having known probability: numbers,
boolean variables (true/false), date/times, symbols, ... Each distribution
is modelled as a plain object, which can be named, displayed, queried or
processed to produce new distribution objects
