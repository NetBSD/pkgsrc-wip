logtools encompasses of a few easy-to-use, easy to configure command-line tools,
typically used in conjunction with Apache logs (but not only).

The idea is to standardize log parsing and filtering using a simple, coherent
configuration methodology and UNIX/POSIX-like command-line interface (STDIN
input streaming, command piping etc.), so as to create a consistent environment
for creating reports, charts and other such log mining artifacts that are
typically employed in a Website context.

logtools can be used either programmatically from within a python program, or as
a set of atomic command-line utilities. See below for description of the command
-line tools.
