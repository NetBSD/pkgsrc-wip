These packages facilitate least-squares fitting of noisy data by
multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many
parameters. The central package is :mod:`lsqfit` which provides
the fitting capability. :mod:`lsqfit` makes heavy use of package
:mod:`gvar`, which provides tools for the analysis of error
propagation, and also for the creation of complicated
multi-dimensional gaussian distributions. :mod:`lsqfit` supports
Bayesian priors for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily
complicated multidimensional gaussian distributions. It uses
automatic differentiation to compute gradients, greatly simplifying
the design of fit functions.
