This library consists of two sublibraries pyFresnel and pyQW for performing
physics simulations. pyFresnel contains codes for modelling the optical
properties of dielectric layers, starting from a simple interface and finishing
with an optical transfer matrix code. Unlike other optical transfer matrix
codes, this code allows for layers with uniaxial dielectrics which
have their the optical axes normal to the plane of the layers.
