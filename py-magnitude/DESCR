A physical quantity is a number with a unit, like 10 km/h. Units can be any of
the SI units, plus a bunch of non-SI, bits,dollars, and any combination of them.
They can include the standard SI prefixes. Magnitude can operate with physical
quantities, parse their units, and print them. You don't have to worry about
unit consistency or conversions; everything is handled transparently.
By default output is done in basic SI units, but you can specify any output unit
as long as it can be reduced to the basic units of the physical quantity
