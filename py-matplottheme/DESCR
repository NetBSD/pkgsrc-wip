MatPlotTheme is a theming library for MatPlotLib. Greatly inspired
by prettyplotlib, MatPlotTheme aims to provide easy-to-use APIs for
creating proper and attractive data visualizations.

In MatPlotTheme, theming MatPlotLib figures is controlled by style and
palette, which defines how elements are customized and which colors are
used, respectively. As MatPlotTheme provides multiple styles/palettes
(at least that is what I am working on), using the library is as simple
as picking a style-palette combination and plot. What's more,
MatPlotTheme inherits MatPlotLib's API configuration, which means
existing code can be migrated with minimal effort.
