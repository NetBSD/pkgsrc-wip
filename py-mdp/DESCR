Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) is a library of widely used data
processing algorithms that can be combined according to a pipeline analogy
to build more complex data processing software. Implemented algorithms
include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis
(ICA), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), and many more
