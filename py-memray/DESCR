Memray is a memory profiler for Python. It can track memory
allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in
the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different
types of reports to help you analyze the captured memory usage
data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a
library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks.
