The Python Macromolecular Library (mmLib) is a software toolkit and library of
routines for the analysis and manipulation of macromolecular structural models,
implemented in the Python programming language. It is accessed via a layered,
object-oriented application programming interface, and provides a range ofuseful
software components for parsing mmCIF, and PDB files, a library of atomic
elements and monomers, an object-oriented data structure describing biological
macromolecules, and an OpenGL molecular viewer. The mmLib data model is designed
to provide easy access to the various levels of detail needed to implement
high-level application programs for macromolecular crystallography, NMR,
modeling, and visualization. This includes specialized classes for proteins, DNA
amino acids, and nucleic acids. Also included is a extensive monomer library,
element library, and specialized classes for performing unit cell calculations
combined with a full space group library.
