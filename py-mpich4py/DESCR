MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python program to
exploit multiple processors.

This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification and provides
an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings. It
supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters,
gathers) communications of any picklable Python object as well as optimized
communications of Python object exposing the single-segment buffer interface
(NumPy arrays, builtin bytes/string/array objects).
