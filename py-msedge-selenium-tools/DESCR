Selenium Tools for Microsoft Edge extends with a unified
driver to help you write automated tests for both the
Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) and new Microsoft Edge (Chromium) browsers

The libraries included in this project are fully compatible

Edge (EdgeHTML) by default so you can use our project as a
seamless drop-in replacement. In addition to being compatible
with your existing Selenium tests, Selenium Tools for
Microsoft Edge gives you the ability to drive the new Microsoft
Edge (Chromium) browser and unlock all of the latest functionality
