Import IPython Notebooks as modules (with Jupyter v4)

Functions in other notebooks are hard to maintain and hamper reproducibility
of other notebooks.** As you use the functions in different projects, you'll
want to fix bugs, make performance improvements or re-write it in a more elegant
fashion. As soon as you start to fix something in the other notebook, you might
break it and your analysis is not reproducible any more
