Ncpol2sdpa is a set of scripts to convert a polynomial optimization problem
of either commutative or noncommutative variables to a sparse semidefinite
programming (SDP) problem that can be processed by the SDPA family of solvers
The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities
and inequalities.
