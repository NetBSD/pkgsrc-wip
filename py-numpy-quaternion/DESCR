This package creates a quaternion type in python, and further
enables numpy to create and manipulate arrays of quaternions.
The usual algebraic operations (addition and multiplication)
are available, along with numerous properties like norm and
various types of distance measures between two quaternions.
There are also additional functions like squad and slerp
interpolation, and conversions to and from axis-angle, matrix,
and Euler-angle representations of rotations
