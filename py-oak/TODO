I am creating this package only as a dependency of py-willow (which I am
going to use).

To make it be a fully working package, someone should write startup scripts
for rc.d

dnsd should be run like:

     dnsd -d --configdir=${PREFIX}/etc/oak --logfile=somelogfile \
	--configfile=${PREFIX}/etc/oak/config.py

add -v to increase verbosity

	-- dotz@irc.pl
