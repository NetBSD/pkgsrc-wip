The Pi Support plugin for OctoPrint provides additional information about your
Pi in the UI and also alerts you about undervoltage or overheating issues
observed on your Pi or if your Pi is unsupported. If you are running OctoPi,
the Pi Support plugin will also provide additional information about that.

OctoPrint will only load this plugin when it detects that it is being run on a
Raspberry Pi.
