OpenTMM is an object-oriented electrodynamic S-matrix (transfer matrix)
code with modern applications.

Electromagnetic wave propagation through planar stratified media
(multilayer stack); the three-dimensional space is divided into layers.
The interfaces separating the layers are assumed to be perfectly planar
and the layers are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous, with a complex
permittivity and permeability.  Moreover, the layers may be composed of a
left-handed material  (negative refractive material) and/or a right-handed
material. The implementation is suitable for the study of modern
applications, e.g., Anderson localization of light and sub-wavelength imaging
