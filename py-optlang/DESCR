Optlang is a Python package for solving mathematical optimization problems,
i.e. maximizing or minimizing an objective function over a set of variables
subject to a number of constraints. Optlang provides a common interface to a
series of optimization tools, so different solver backends can be changed in
a transparent way. Optlangâ€™s object-oriented API takes advantage of the symbolic
math library sympy to allow objective functions and constraints to be easily
formulated from symbolic expressions of variables (see examples).
