The Object Relational Membrane is a Python package that provides the
functionality of an object relational layer like EJB or other persistence
storage systems. It is a thin compatibility layer between SQL table layouts
and Object Oriented Python. While providing a good deal of functionality, it
tries to be as small and simple as possible. It currently works with
PostgreSQL, Firebird and MySQL.
