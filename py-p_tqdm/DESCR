p_tqdm is a wrapper around pathos.multiprocessing and tqdm.
Unlike Python's default multiprocessing library, pathos provides
a more flexible parallel map which can apply almost any type of
function including lambda functions, nested functions, and class
methods and can easily handle functions with multiple arguments.
tqdm is applied on top of pathos's parallel map and displays a
progress bar including an estimated time to completion
