net/py-paho-mqtt: Update to 2.0.0

Upstream NEWS less bugfixes

This release include breaking change. See migrations.md for more details on how to upgrade.

    BREAKING Added callback_api_version. This break ALL users of paho-mqtt Client class.
    See migrations.md for details on how to upgrade.
    tl; dr; add CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION1 to first argument of Client()

    BREAKING Drop support for Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6
    Minimum tested version is Python 3.7
    Python version up to Python 3.12 are tested.

    BREAKING connect_srv changed it signature to take an additional bind_port parameter.
    This is a breaking change, but in previous version connect_srv was broken anyway.
    Closes #493.

    BREAKING Remove some deprecated argument and method:
        max_packets argument in loop(), loop_write() and loop_forever() is removed
        force argument in loop_stop() is removed
        method message_retry_set() is removed

    Possible breaking change: Add properties to access most Client attribute. Closes #764.
    Since this add new properties like logger, if a sub-class defined logger, the two logger
    will conflict.

    Add version 2 of user-callback which allow to access MQTTv5 reason code & properties that were
    missing from on_publish callback. Also it's more consistent in parameter order or between
    MQTTv3 and MQTTv5.

    Add types to Client class, which caused few change which should be compatible.
    Known risk of breaking changes:
        Use enum for returned error code (like MQTT_ERR_SUCCESS). It use an IntEnum
        which should be a drop-in replacement. Excepted if someone is doing "rc is 0" instead of "rc == 0".
        reason in on_connect callback when using MQTTv5 is now always a ReasonCode object. It used to possibly be
        an integer with the value 132.
        MQTTMessage field "dup" and "retain" used to be integer with value 0 and 1. They are now boolean.

    Add support for ALPN protocols on TLS connection. Closes #790 & #648.

    Add on_pre_connect() callback, which is called immediately before a
    connection attempt is made.
