Param is a library providing Parameters: Python attributes extended to have
features such as type and range checking, dynamically generated values,
documentation strings, default values, etc., each of which is inherited
from parent classes if not specified in a subclass. Param lets you program
declaratively in Python, by just stating facts about each of your parameters,
and then using them throughout your code. With Parameters, error checking will
be automatic, which eliminates huge amounts of boilerplate code that would
otherwise be required to verify or test user-supplied values.

Param-based programs tend to contain much less code than other Python programs,
instead just having easily readable and maintainable manifests of Parameters
for each object or function. This way your remaining code can be much simpler
and clearer, while users can also easily see how to use it properly.
