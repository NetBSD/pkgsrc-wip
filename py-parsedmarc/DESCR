parsedmarc is a Python module and CLI utility for parsing DMARC
reports. When used with Elasticsearch and Kibana (or Splunk), it
works as a self-hosted open source alternative to commercial DMARC
report processing services such as Agari Brand Protection, Dmarcian,
OnDMARC, ProofPoint Email Fraud Defense, and Valimail.
