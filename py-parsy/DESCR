Parsy is an easy way to combine simple, small parsers into complex,
larger parsers. If it means anything to you, it's a monadic parser
combinator library for LL(infinity) grammars in the spirit of Parsec,
Parsnip, and Parsimmon. But don't worry, it has really good documentation
and it doesn't say things like that!
