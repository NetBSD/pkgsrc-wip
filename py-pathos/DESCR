pathos is a framework for heterogeneous computing. It provides a
consistent high-level interface for configuring and launching parallel
computations across heterogeneous resources. pathos provides
configurable launchers for parallel and distributed computing, where each
launcher contains the syntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an
execution environment. Examples of launchers that plug into pathos are:
a queue-less MPI-based launcher (in pyina), a ssh-based launcher (in
pathos), and a multi-process launcher (in multiprocess).

pathos provides a consistent interface for parallel and/or distributed
versions of map and apply for each launcher, thus lowering the
barrier for users to extend their code to parallel and/or distributed
resources. The guiding design principle behind pathos is that map
