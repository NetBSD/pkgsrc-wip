Plucker is an offline Web and e-book viewer for Palm OS based handheld
devices and PDAs and comes with Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X
tools, scripts, and conduits that let you decide exactly what part of
the World Wide Web you'd like to download onto your PDA (as long as
they're in standard HTML or text format).  These web pages are then
processed, compressed, and transferred to the PDA for viewing by the
Plucker viewer.

PyPlucker is a Python module that provides the set of tools fetching
the web pages you specify, and handles the conversion of them to
Plucker format.
