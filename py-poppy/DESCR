POPPY is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation
including diffraction. It implements a flexible framework for modeling
Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread
function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes.
POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for JWST, but is more
broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations
