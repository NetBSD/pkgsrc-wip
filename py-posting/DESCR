Posting is an HTTP client, not unlike Postman and Insomnia. As a
TUI application, it can be used over SSH and enables efficient
keyboard-centric workflows. Your requests are stored locally in
simple YAML files, meaning they're easy to read and version control.

Some notable features include: "jump mode" navigation,
environments/variables system with autocompletion, syntax highlighting
powered by tree-sitter, Vim keys, various builtin themes, a
configuration system, "open in $EDITOR", and a command palette for
quickly accessing functionality.
