Parallel Python module (pp) provides an easy and efficient way to create
parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters. pp module
features cross-platform portability and dynamic load balancing. Thus application
written with PP will parallelize efficiently even on heterogeneous and
multi-platform clusters (including clusters  running other application with
variable CPU loads).
