Parallel Python module (pp) provides an easy and efficient way to
create parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters. pp
module features cross-platform portability and dynamic load balancing. Thus
application written with ``pp`` will parallelize efficiently even on
heterogeneous and multi-platform clusters (including clusters running other
application with variable CPU loads)
