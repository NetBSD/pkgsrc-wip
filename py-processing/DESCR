Processing is a Python package which supports the spawning of processes
using the API of the standard library's threading module. Features include:

 * Objects can  be transferred  between  processes using pipes or
   multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.
 * Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or
   (for simple data) shared memory.
 * Equivalents  of all the synchronization primitives in threading
   are available.
 * A Pool class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker
   processes.
