ProjectQ is an open source effort for quantum computing.

It features a compilation framework capable of targeting various types
of hardware, a high-performance quantum computer simulator with emulation
capabilities, and various compiler plug-ins. This allows users to

- run quantum programs on the IBM Quantum Experience chip
- simulate quantum programs on classical computers
- emulate quantum programs at a higher level of abstraction
 (e.g., mimicking the action of large oracles instead of compiling
 them to low-level gates)
- export quantum programs as circuits (using TikZ)
- get resource estimates
