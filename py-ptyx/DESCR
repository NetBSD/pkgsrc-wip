pTyX is a LaTeX precompilator, written in Python.
pTyX enables to generate LaTeX documents, using custom commands or plain 
python code. One single pTyX file may generate many latex documents, with 
different values. I developped and used pTyX to make several different 
versions of a same test in exams,for my student, to discourage cheating.
Since it uses sympy library, pTyX has symbolic calculus abilities too.
