Pweave is a scientific report generator and a literate programming tool
for Python. Pweave can capture the results and plots from data analysis and
works well with numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Pweave is inspired by Sweave,
an excellent tool for R programmers, and the syntax is mostly compatible with
it. Pweave supports reST, Sphinx, Latex, and Pandoc markdown markups.

Pweave uses the noweb syntax for separating code from documentation, but it
also supports ERB style evaluation of inline code. Pweave is able to weave a
python code between <<>>=  and @ blocks and include the results and capture
matplotlib plots in the  document. Inline code in documentation chunks is marked
using <% %> (code will be evaluated in place) and <%= %> (result of expression
will be printed) tags. Pweave is good for creating reports and tutorials.
t  can also be used to make  websites together with Sphinx or rest2web.
