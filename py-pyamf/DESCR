PyAMF provides Action Message Format (AMF) support for Python  that is
compatible with the Adobe Flash Player. It includes integration with Python web
frameworks like Django, Pylons, Twisted, SQLAlchemy, web2py and more.

The Adobe Integrated Runtime and Adobe Flash Player use AMF to communicate
between an application and a remote server. AMF encodes remote procedure calls
(RPC) into a compact binary representation that can be transferred over
 HTTP/HTTPS or the RTMP/RTMPS protocol. Objects and data values are serialized
into this binary format, which increases performance, allowing applications to
load data up to 10 times faster than with text-based formats such as XML or
SOAP.

AMF3, the default serialization for ActionScript 3.0, provides various
advantages over AMF0, which is used for ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. AMF3 sends
data over the network more efficiently than AMF0. AMF3 supports sending int and
uint objects as integers and supports data types that are available only in
ActionScript 3.0, such as ByteArray, ArrayCollection, ObjectProxy and
IExternalizable.
