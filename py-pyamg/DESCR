AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with
optimal or near-optimal efficiency. Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires
little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a
sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix. This feature is
especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes
and irregular grids.
