This package contains the asynchat module as found in Python
versions prior to 3.12.
It is provided so that existing code relying on `import asynchat`
is able to continue being used without significant refactoring.

Please note that new projects should prefer asyncio.

The module can be installed for earlier Python versions, but it will
have no effect, and the standard library version of `asynchat` will be
used in its place.
