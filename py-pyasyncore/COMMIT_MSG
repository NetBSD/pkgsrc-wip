devel/py-pyasyncore: added pyasyncore 1.0.4

This package contains the asyncore module as found in Python versions prior
to 3.12.
It is provided so that existing code relying on `import asyncore` is able to
continue being used without significant refactoring.

Please note that new projects should prefer asyncio.

The module can be installed for earlier Python versions, but it will have no
effect, and the standard library version of `asyncore` will be used in its
place.
