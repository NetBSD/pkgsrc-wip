PyCIFRW provides support for reading and writing CIF (Crystallographic
Information Format) files using Python.  It was developed at the
Australian National Beamline Facility (ANBF), run by the Australian
Synchrotron Research Program (ASRP), as part of a larger project to
provide CIF input/output capabilities for data collection.  It is
currently (Mar 2006) under active development and testing.
