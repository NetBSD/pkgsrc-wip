Pyevolve was developed to be a complete genetic algorithm framework written in
 pure python. The main objectives of Pyevolve are:
 .
  * written in pure python  - to maximize the cross-platform aspect
  * easy to use API         - the API must be easy to the end-user
  * see the evolution       - the user can and must see and interact with the
                              evolution statistics, graphs, etc.
  * extensible              - the API must be extensible, the user can create
                              new representations, genetic operators such as
                              crossover, mutation, etc.
  * fast                    - the design must be optimized for performance
  * common features         - the framework must implement the most common
                              features: selectors like roulette wheel,
                              tournament, ranking, uniform. Scaling schemes
                              such as linear scaling, etc.
  * default parameters      - we must have default operators, settings, etc
                              in all options
  * open-source             - the source is for everyone, not only for one.
