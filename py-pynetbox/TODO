Figure out how this is supposed to be built / installed.

The package has a setup.py file which contains
    setup_requires=["setuptools_scm"],
and after adding it as a DEPENDS, I now get an error message
saying

  File "/usr/pkg/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools_scm/__init__.py", line 109, in _version_missing
    raise LookupError(
LookupError: setuptools-scm was unable to detect version for /usr/pkgsrc/wip/py-pynetbox/work/pynetbox-7.3.3.

Make sure you're either building from a fully intact git repository or PyPI tarballs. Most other sources (such as GitHub's tarballs, a git checkout without the .git folder) don't contain the necessary metadata and will not work.

For example, if you're using pip, instead of https://github.com/user/proj/archive/master.zip use git+https://github.com/user/proj.git#egg=proj

But ... what if anything of this do we follow in pkgsrc?
