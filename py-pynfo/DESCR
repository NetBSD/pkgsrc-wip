Pynfo is a combination IRC info, search, and network relay bot. It supports
basic fact definition (with persistence between runs) and searching of
Google and Dict.org. In the network relay mode it "bridges" channels on
different networks by passing messages between them. It also has a plugin
interface, allowing users to easily define new commands.
