Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse
set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization
models. Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem
instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers. Pyomo supports a
wide range of problem types, including:

    Linear programming
    Quadratic programming
    Nonlinear programming
    Mixed-integer linear programming
    Mixed-integer quadratic programming
    Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
    Mixed-integer stochastic programming
    Generalized disjunctive programming
    Differential algebraic equations
    Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints
    Constraint programming
