The PySide project provides LGPL-licensed Python bindings for the Qt.
It also includes complete toolchain for rapidly generating bindings for
any Qt-based C++ class hierarchies. PySide Qt bindings allow both free
open source and proprietary software development and ultimately aim to
support Qt platforms.

This package installs PySide development tools (pyuic and pyrcc).
