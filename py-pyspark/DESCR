processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java,
Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports
general computation graphs for data analysis. It also
supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark
SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning,
GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming
