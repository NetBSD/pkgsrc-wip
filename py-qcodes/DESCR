QCoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by
the Copenhagen/Delft/Sydney/Microsoft quantum computing consortium.
While it has been developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic device
experiments, it is not inherently limited to such experiments, and can
be used anywhere a system with many degrees of freedom is controllable
by computer
