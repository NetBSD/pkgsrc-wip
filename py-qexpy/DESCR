QExPy (Queen's Experimental Physics) is a python 3 package designed to
facilitate data analysis in undergraduate physics laboratories.
The package contains a module to easily propagate errors in uncertainty
calculations, and a module that provides an intuitive interface to plot
and fit data. The package is designed to be efficient, correct, and to
allow for a pedagogic introduction to error analysis. The package is
extensively tested in the Jupyter Notebook environment to allow high
quality reports to be generated directly from a browser
