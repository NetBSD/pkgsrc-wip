Qiskit Aqua is an extensible, modular, open-source library of quantum
computing algorithms. Researchers can experiment with Aqua algorithms,
on near-term quantum devices and simulators, and can also get involved
by contributing new algorithms and algorithm-supporting objects, such
as optimizers and variational forms. Qiskit Aqua also contains application
domain support in the form of the chemistry, finance, machine learning
and optimization modules to experiment with real-world applications
to quantum computing.
