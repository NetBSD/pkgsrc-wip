**Qiskit** is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that work together to enable quantum computing. This is a simple meta-package to install the elements of Qiskit altogether.

## Installation

The best way of installing `qiskit` is by using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install qiskit
```

See [install](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html) Qiskit for detailed instructions, how to use virtual environments, and
build from source standalone versions of the individual Qiskit elements and components.
