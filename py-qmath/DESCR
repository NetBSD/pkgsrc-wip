qmath provides a class for deal with quaternion algebra and 3D rotations.
Root evaluations and Moebius transformations are implemented.

This class provides the methods to deal algebrically with quaternions.
Quaternions operations are implemented, including square and cubic roots
evaluations. Hurwitz quaternions can also be used. For Hurwitz quaternions
modular operations are implemented. Moreover, other algebraic tools
are available, such as Cross Ratio and Moebius transformations
