The qupulse project aims to produce a software toolkit facilitating experiments
involving pulse driven state manipulation of physical qubits.

It provides a high-level hardware-independent representation of pulses as well
as means to translate this representation to hardware-specific device
instructions and waveforms, execute these instructions and perform
corresponding measurements.

Pulses can be assembled from previously defined subpulses, allowing easy
construction of high-level from low-level pulses and re-use of previous work.
Additionally, all pulses are parameterizable allowing users to fine-tune and
adapt pulse templates to specific hardware or functionality without redefining
an entire pulse sequence. To ensure meaningful parameter values, constraints
can be put on parameters on a per-pulse basis.
