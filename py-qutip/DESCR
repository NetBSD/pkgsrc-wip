QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of
open quantum systems.  The QuTiP library depends on the
excellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages. In addition,
graphical output is provided by Matplotlib.  QuTiP aims
to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations
of a wide variety of Hamiltonian's, including those with
arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of
physics applications. QuTiP is freely available for use and/or
modification on all Unix based platforms. Being free of any
licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanic
and dynamics in the classroom
