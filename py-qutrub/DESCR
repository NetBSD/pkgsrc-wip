Web interface for the Arabic verb conjugator Qutrub. The purpose of this
software is to simplify automating conjugation for Arabic verbs. This software
is part of the Arabic spellchecker project, focused on studying the behavior of
Arabic verbs, to be able to identify the conjugated verbs and its root, and thus
be able to spell check it or search for it. Qutrub conjugates a verb with
minimal input (vocalized verb, the future mark), and conjugates it in a generic
way. It doesn't use classified models of verb conjugation. Qutrub detects the
verb class and conjugates it in the appropriate form. Qutrub offers many
features:

 -Conjugation for past, future, imperative and passive voices.
 -Suggestion for trilateral verbs.
