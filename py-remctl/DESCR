Python bindings for remctl remote command execution

remctl is a client/server application that supports remote
execution of specific commands, using Kerberos v5 GSS-API for
authentication.  Authorization is controlled by a configuration
file and ACL files and can be set separately for each command,
unlike with rsh.  remctl is like a Kerberos-authenticated simple
CGI server, or a combination of Kerberos rsh and sudo without
most of the features and complexity of either.

This module provides Python bindings to the remctl client
library.
