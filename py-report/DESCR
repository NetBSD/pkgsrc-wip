Pyreport makes notes out of a python script. It can run the script in a sandbox
and capture its output. It allows for embedding RestructuredText or LaTeX
comments in the code for literate programming and generates a report made
of the literate comments, the code, pretty printed, and the output of the script
(pyreport can capture pylab figures). This is useful for documentations, making
tutorials, but also for  sharing python-based calculations with colleagues
