Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools
while integrating more functionality behind a single, common
interface.

Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort,
pydocstyle, yesqa, eradicate, pyupgrade, and autoflake, all while
executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual
tool.
