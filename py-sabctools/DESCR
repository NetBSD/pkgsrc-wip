C implementations of functions for use within SABnzbd.

This module implements three main sets of C implementations that are used
within SABnzbd:

    yEnc decoding and encoding using SIMD routines
    CRC32 calculations
    Non-blocking SSL-socket reading
    Marking files as sparse

Of course, they can also be used in any other application.
