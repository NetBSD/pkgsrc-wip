A package designed to wrap a build so that all calls to gcc/clang
are intercepted and logged into a compilation database and/or piped
to the clang static analyzer. Includes intercept-build tool, which
logs the build, as well as scan-build tool, which logs the build
and runs the clang static analyzer on it.
