Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, packet generator,
network scanner, network discovery, packet sniffer, etc. It can for the
moment replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump,
tethereal, p0f, ....

Scapy uses the python interpreter as a command board. That means that you
can use directly python language (assign variables, use loops, define
functions, etc.) If you give a file as parameter when you run scapy, your
session (variables, functions, intances, ...) will be saved when you leave
the interpretor, and restored the next time you launch scapy.

Scapy is not user proof yet. But it is almost reliable. Some more things
need to be done to support more platforms.

The idea is simple. Those kind of tools do two things : sending packets and
receiving answers. That's what scapy does : you define a set of packets, it
sends them, receives answers, matches requests with answers and returns a
list of packet couples (request, answer) and a list of unmatched packets.
This has the big advantage over tools like nmap or hping that an answer is
not reduced to (open/closed/filtered), but is the whole packet.
