0.21.0

Highlights

    Last release to support Python 3.8
    Unified API for PRNGs

New Features

    Implement Fisher vectors in scikit-image (#5349).
    Add support for y-dimensional shear to the AffineTransform (#6752).


0.20.0

With this release, many of the functions in skimage.measure now
support anisotropic images with different voxel spacings.

Many performance improvements were made, such as support for
footprint decomposition in skimage.morphology

Four new gallery examples were added to the documentation, including
the new interactive example "Track solidification of a metallic
alloy".

This release completes the transition to a more flexible channel_axis
parameter for indicating multi-channel images, and includes several
other deprecations that make the API more consistent and expressive.

Finally, in preparation for the removal of distutils in the upcoming
Python 3.12 release, we replaced our build system with meson and
a static pyproject.toml specification.

This release supports Python 3.8--3.11.
