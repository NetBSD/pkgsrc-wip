Talkbox is set of python modules for speech/signal processing. The goal of this
toolbox is to be a sandbox for features which may end up in scipy at some
point. The following features are planned before a 1.0 release:

    * Spectrum estimation related functions: both parametic (lpc, high
    resolution methods like music and co), and non-parametric (Welch,
    periodogram)
    * Fourier-like transforms (DCT, DST, MDCT, etc...)
    * Basic signal processing tasks such as resampling
    * Speech related functionalities: mfcc, mel spectrum, etc..
    * More as it comes
