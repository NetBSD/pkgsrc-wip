Sempy is a numerical software package designed to solve partial differential
equations arising from the analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer. It is
written in Python and carries the  ntuitive syntax of this language.
Furthermore computational meshes can be imported from the Gmsh
mesh generator, making Sempy flexible towards handling complex geometries.
