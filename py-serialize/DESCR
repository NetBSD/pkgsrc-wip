Serialize: A common Python API for multiple serialization formats
=================================================================

There are multiple serialization formats out there ...

                        ... and great packages to use them.

But they all have a different API and switching among them is not so simple
as it should be. Serialize helps you to do it, including dealing with custom
classes. Let's dump a dict using the `pickle` format:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from serialize import dumps, loads
    >>> dumps(dict(answer=42), fmt='pickle')
    b'\x80\x03}q\x00X\x06\x00\x00\x00answerq\x01K*s.'
    >>> loads(_, fmt='pickle')
    {'answer': 42}

And here comes the cool thing, you can just change the serialization format
...
