Shtoom is a open-source, cross-platform VoIP softphone, implemented in
Python. As well as the basic phone, the package also includes a number of
other applications - 

 * shtoom - the end-user phone
 * shtam - a simple answering machine/voicemail application
 * shmessage - an announcement server

Shtoom should work on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It ships with user
interfaces for Qt/KDE, Gtk/GNOME, Tk and a command line. There will
hopefully be native user interfaces for Windows and the Mac soon, until
then, the Tk interface works on those platforms.
