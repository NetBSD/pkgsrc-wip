SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python.
This standard (also known as "XMLDSig") is used to provide payload security
in SAML 2.0, XAdES, EBICS, and WS-Security, among other uses. The standard
is defined in the W3C Recommendation XML Signature Syntax and Processing
Version 1.1. SignXML implements all of the required components of the
Version 1.1 standard, and most recommended ones.
