SIMA (Sequential IMage Analysis) is an Open Source package for analysis of
time-series imaging data arising from fluorescence microscopy.
The functionality of this package includes:

correction of motion artifacts
segmentation of imaging fields into regions of interest (ROIs)
extraction of dynamic signals from ROIs

The included ROI Buddy software provides a graphical user interface (GUI)
supporting the following functionality:

manual creation of ROIs
editing of ROIs resulting from automated segmentation
registration of ROIs across separate imaging sessions
