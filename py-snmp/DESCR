This is a Python implementation of SNMP v.1/v.2c engine. Its general
functionality is to assemble/disassemble SNMP messages from/into
given SNMP Object IDs along with associated values. PySNMP also provides
a few transport methods specific to TCP/IP networking.

PySNMP is written entirely in Python and is self-sufficient in terms
that it does not rely on any third party tool (it is not a wrapper!).

The PySNMP package is distributed under terms and conditions of BSD-style
license.
