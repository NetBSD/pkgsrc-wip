The SpamBayes project is working on developing a Bayesian anti-spam filter,
initially based on the work of Paul Graham. The major difference between
this and other, similar projects is the emphasis on testing newer approaches
to scoring messages. While most anti-spam projects are still working with
the original graham algorithm, we found that a number of alternate methods
yielded a more useful response. This is documented on the background page.

SpamBayes is not a single application. The core code is a message
classifier, however there are several applications available as part of the
SpamBayes project which use the classifier in specific contexts. For the
most part, the current crop of applications all operate on the client side
of things, however, a number of people have experimented with using
SpamBayes on mail servers to classify incoming mail for multiple users. The
table below outlines the main applications which are part of the SpamBayes
distribution.
