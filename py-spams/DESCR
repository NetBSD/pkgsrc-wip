SPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various
sparse estimation problems
Dictionary learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...)
Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate descent, OMP, SOMP,
proximal methods
Solving structured sparse decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse
group lasso,
tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with overlapping groups,...)
