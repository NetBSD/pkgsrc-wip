'FixedPoint (SPFPM) is a pure-Python module which provides
basic facilities for manipulating fixed-point numbers
of essentially arbitrary precision It aims to be more suitable for simulating
binary fixed-point artihmetic within electronic hardware
(e.g. for digital signal processing (DSP) applications) than the Decimal package,
which is more concerned with fixed-point arithmetic in base-10
SPFPM supports basic arithmetic operations as well as a range
of mathematical functions including sqrt, exp, sin, cos, atan etc.
