A flexible framework for analyzing and transforming netlists. Built to fill an
important gap in FPGA research and reliability.

SpyDrNet can be used to create netlists from scratch. Because it is a low-level
framework, manual netlist creation can be tedious (much like writting a high
level application in assembly). To assist in rapid productivity, parsers and
composers are provided for common netlist formats.
