spyse is a development framework and platform for building multi-agent systems
using the Python programming language. A multi-agent system (MAS) combines
concepts from distributed computing and artificial intelligence. Agents are
autonomously reasoning software entities that can collaborate (or compete) in
order to achieve a (common) goal. By cooperating they create emergent behaviour
in the system (distributed artificial intelligence). The architecture of a MAS
is specified in the FIPA standard.

Spyse provides multiple means for reasoning (BDI logics, CLIPS expert shell)
and communicating locally and remotely.Each agent has its own thread of control.
Agents within and among instances of the platform communicate by
exchanging messages based on ontologies. Spyse makes use of the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) defined for the Semantic Web.

Furthermore, spyse is coupled to the Zope web application server in order to
provide for access to the MAS via a dynamic Web interface.
