SQLAlchemy-JSON provides mutation-tracked JSON types to SQLAlchemy

- MutableJson is a straightforward implementation for keeping track
of top-level changes to JSON objects;
- NestedMutableJson is an extension of this which tracks changes even
when these happen in nested objects or arrays (Python dicts and lists)
