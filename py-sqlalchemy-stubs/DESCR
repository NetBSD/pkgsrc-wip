This package contains stubs and a mypy plugin to provide
more precise static types and type inference for SQLAlchemy
framework. SQLAlchemy uses some Python magic that makes
having precise types for some code patterns problematic.
This is why we need to accompany the stubs with mypy plugins.
The final goal is to be able to get precise types for most common
patterns.
