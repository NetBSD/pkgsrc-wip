Python CLI utility and library for manipulating SQLite databases.

This library and command-line utility helps create SQLite databases
from an existing collection of data.

Most of the functionality is available as either a Python API or
through the sqlite-utils command-line tool.

sqlite-utils is not intended to be a full ORM: the focus is utility
helpers to make creating the initial database and populating it with
data as productive as possible.
