Simple Remote Python (SRPy) intends to harness the power of the Python by
allowing multiple python programs (instances) to seamlessly communicate and
share information between each other. As such, each CPU (or core) in each
computer can be considered as an individual that can request for other
individuals to store information or run processing tasks. In this context, SRPy
abstracts itself from the physical boundaries between processors and computers
by looking at them simply as volunteer workers that are able to deal with
workloads this workers can even work in a social manner by communicating with
each other on a non-centralized way, sharing information and processing requests
