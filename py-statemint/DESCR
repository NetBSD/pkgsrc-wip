The StateMint Python package is an implementation based on
 [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org)  which allows this code to easily combined with
simulation and analysis code, or integrated into other systems. The package
provides a `Solve` function which takes the input variables, state variable
elemental equations, non-state variable elemental equations, constraint
equations, and  output variables and returns a Python object with multiple forms
of the solution
