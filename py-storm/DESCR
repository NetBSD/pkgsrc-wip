Storm is an Object Relational Mapper for Python.

    * Storm is fast.
    * Storm lets you efficiently access and update large datasets
    by allowing you to formulate complex queries spanning multiple
    tables using Python.
    * Storm allows you to fallback to SQL if needed (or if you just
    prefer), allowing you to mix "old school" code and ORM code
    * Storm handles composed primary keys with ease (no need for
    surrogate keys).
    * Storm doesn't do schema management, and as a result you're
    free to manage the schema as wanted, and creating classes that
    work with Storm is clean and simple.
    * Storm works very well connecting to several databases and
    using the same Python types (or different ones) with all of
    them.
    * Storm can handle obj.attr = <A SQL expression> assignments,
    when that's really needed (the expression is executed at
    INSERT/UPDATE time).
    * Storm handles relationships between objects even before they
    were added to a database.
    * Storm works well with existing database schemas.
    * Storm will flush changes to the database automatically when
    needed, so that queries made affect recently modified objects.
