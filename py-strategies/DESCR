This project contains a set of complementary higher order functions that loosely
 resembles the Stratego language.

This project was inspired by the Stratego language for programmatic control in
the Stratego/XT project. It was first implemented as part of the
SymPy](http://sympy.org) Python library for symbolic algebra but was then
spun off as a separate project.
