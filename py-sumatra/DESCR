Sumatra is a tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical
simulation and/or analysis, with the aim of supporting
reproducible research. It can be thought of as an automated electronic lab
notebook for computational projects.
It consists of:

        * a command-line interface, smt, for launching simulations/analyses with
 	   automatic recording of information about the experiment, annotating these
            records, linking to data files, etc.
        * a web interface with a built-in web-server, smtweb, for browsing and
	   annotating simulation/analysis results.
        * a Python API, on which smt and smtweb are based, that can be used
            in your own scripts in place of using smt, or could be integrated
             into a GUI-based application.
