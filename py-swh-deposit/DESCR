# swh-deposit

This is [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org)'s
[SWORD 2.0](http://swordapp.github.io/SWORDv2-Profile/SWORDProfile.html) Server
implementation, as well as a simple client to upload deposits on the server.

**S.W.O.R.D** (**S**imple **W**eb-Service **O**ffering **R**epository
**D**eposit) is an interoperability standard for digital file deposit.

This implementation will permit interaction between a client (a
repository) and a server (SWH repository) to permit deposits of
software source code archives and associated metadata.

The documentation is at ./docs/README-specification.md
