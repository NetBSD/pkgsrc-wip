swh-lister
==========

This component from the Software Heritage stack aims to produce listings
of software origins and their urls hosted on various public developer platforms
or package managers. As these operations are quite similar, it provides a set of
Python modules abstracting common software origins listing behaviors.

It also provides several lister implementations, contained in the
following Python modules:

- `swh.lister.bitbucket`
- `swh.lister.cgit`
- `swh.lister.cran`
- `swh.lister.debian`
- `swh.lister.gitea`
- `swh.lister.github`
- `swh.lister.gitlab`
- `swh.lister.gnu`
- `swh.lister.launchpad`
...
