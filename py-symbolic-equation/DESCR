A simple Python package providing the Eq class for manipulating
symbolic equations

The Eq class defines an equation, and allows to apply arbitrary manipulations
to the left-hand-side and/or right-hand-side of that equation. It keeps track
all of these manipulations, and displays them neatly as a multi-line equation
in an interactive interpreter session or a Jupyter notebook (using a LaTeX
representation). It is mainly intended for use with SymPy
