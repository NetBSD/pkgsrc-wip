SymPad is a simple single script graphical symbolic calculator/scratchpad
using SymPy for the math, MathJax for the display in a browser and matplotlib
for plotting.
User input is intended to be quick, easy and intuitive and is displayed in
symbolic form as it is being entered. Sympad will accept Python expressions,
LaTeX formatting, unicode math symbols and a native shorthand intended for
quick entry, or a mix of all of these.
The input will be evaluated symbolically or numerically with the results being
copy/pasteable in Python or LaTeX formats, so it acts as a translator as well.
