The aim of the  SympyCore  project is to seek out new high Performance
solutions to represent and manipulate symbolic expressions in the Python
programming language, and to try out new symbolic models to achive fundamentally
consistent and sufficiently general symbolic model that would be easy to extend
to a Computer Algebra System (CAS).

See SympyCore Demo and SympyCore User's Guide for examples. Various performance
improvements are reported in Performance History and SympyCore Benchmark sites.

Sympycore is inspired by many attempts to implement CAS for Python and it is
created to fix SymPy performance and robustness issues. Sympycore does not yet
have nearly as many features as SymPy. Our goal is to work on in direction of
merging the efforts with the SymPy project in the future.
