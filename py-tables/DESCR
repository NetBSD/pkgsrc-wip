PyTables is a hierarchical database package designed to efficiently
manage very large amounts of data. PyTables is built on top of the
HDF5 library and the numarray package. It features an object-oriented
interface that, combined with natural naming and C-code generated from
Pyrex sources, makes it a fast, yet extremely easy-to-use tool for
interactively saving and retrieving very large amounts of data.  It also
provides flexible indexed access on disk to anywhere in the data.
