talk2stat allows programs (such as latextopdf, nodejs) to communicate
with statistical packages. Currently, we connect with R, julia, matlab,
or python but extending it to other tools like Stata or SAS, is very
simple. The package contains two main functions: server() talks to the
client program (e.g latextopdf) via a socket (inet), and to the stats
package (R, julia, matlab, python) via a bi-directional pipe. The client()
function is called by the user (e.g. latextopdf) to establish a connection
with the server and pass code to the statistical package, and get the results.
