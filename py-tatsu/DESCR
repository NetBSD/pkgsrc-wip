TatSu (the successor to Grako) is a tool that takes grammars in a variation of
EBNF as input, and outputs memoizing (Packrat) PEG parsers in Python.

TatSu can compile a grammar stored in a string into a tatsu.grammars.Grammar
object that can be used to parse any given input, much like the re module does
with regular expressions, or it can generate a Python module that implements

the parser. TatSu has experimental support for left-recursive rules in PEG
grammars using the algorithm by Laurent and Mens. The generated AST has the
expected left associativity.
