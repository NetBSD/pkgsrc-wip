A little library which renders LaTeX to various
formats, using applications on your system like
latex, pdflatex, bibtex, dvips, ps2eps, and convert.
LaTeX is automatically run as many times as necessary
to achieve a clean compile (with a user-provided max
number of attempts), and Bibtex processing is supported.
