textX is a meta-language for building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in
Python. In a nutshell, textX will help you build your textual language
in an easy way. You can invent your own language or build a support for
already existing textual language or file format. From a single language
description (grammar), textX will build a parser and a meta-model for the
language.
