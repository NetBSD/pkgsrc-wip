thLib utility primarily contains unctions for working with 3D kinematics.(i.e
quaternions and rotation matrices). In addition, it has a number of routines for
fitting circles, lines, sine-waves, and exponential decays. For signal
processing,a Savitzky-Golay filter is included, as well as a demonstration of
the calculation of a power spectrum.
