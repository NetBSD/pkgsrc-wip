Thermo is open-source software for engineers, scientists, technicians and
anyone trying to understand the universe in more detail. It facilitates the
retrieval of constants of chemicals, the calculation of temperature and
pressure dependent chemical properties (both thermodynamic and transport), and
the calculation of the same for chemical mixtures (including phase equilibria)
using various models.
