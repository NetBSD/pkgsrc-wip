OEPLITZ is a FORTRAN90 library which solves a variety of Toeplitz and circulant
linear systems. The package can also handle circulant Toeplitz systems, and
some other more complicated but related forms. The TOEPLITZ package was written
in the early 1980's by a joint working group of American and Soviet
mathematicians. The original, true, correct version of TOEPLITZ is available
in the TOEPLITZ subdirectory of the NETLIB web site
