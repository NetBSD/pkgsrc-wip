Social networks are not new, even though websites like Facebook and Twitter
might make you want to believe they are; and trust me- I'm not talking about
Myspace! Social networks are extremely interesting models for human behavior,
whose study dates back to the early twentieth century. However, because of
those websites, data scientists have access to much more data than
the anthropologists who studied the networks of tribes!
