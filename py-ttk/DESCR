This ttk wrapper provides classes to allow using the Tk themed widget set,
as well some extensions, under Python.Ttk is based on a revised and enhanced
version of TIP #48 (http://tip.tcl.tk/48) specified style engine.

Its basic idea is to separate, to the extent possible, the code implementing
a widget's behavior from the code implementing its appearance. Widget class
bindings are primarily responsible for maintaining the widget state and invoking
callbacks, all aspects of the widgets appearance lies at Themes.
