Load and dump json-like data into typed data structures.

This module provides an API to load dictionaries and lists (usually loaded from
json) into Python's NamedTuples, dataclass, sets, enums, and various other typed
data structures; respecting all the type-hints and performing type checks or
casts when needed.

It can also dump from typed data structures to json-like dictionaries and lists.
It is very useful for projects that use Mypy and deal with untyped data like
json, because it guarantees that the data will have the expected format.
