It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
it in ASCII. For example when integrating with legacy code that doesn't support
Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman names on a US keyboard, or when
constructing ASCII machine identifiers from human-readable Unicode strings that
should still be somewhat intelligible (a popular example of this is when making
an URL slug from an article title).

In most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as ??? or
\\15BA\\15A0\\1610, to mention two extreme cases. But that's nearly useless to
someone who actually wants to read what the text says.

What Unidecode provides is a middle road: the function unidecode() takes Unicode
data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken when
mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human with a US
keyboard would choose.

The quality of resulting ASCII representation varies. For languages of western
origin it should be between perfect and good. On the other hand transliteration
(i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
some other writing system) of languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a
very complex issue and this library does not even attempt to address it. It
draws the line at context-free character-by-character mapping. So a good rule of
thumb is that the further the script you are transliterating is from Latin
alphabet, the worse the transliteration will be.

Note that this module generally produces better results than simply stripping
accents from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions).
It is based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
