UPSILoN (AUtomated Classification of Periodic Variable Stars using MachIne
LearNing) aims to classify periodic variable stars such as Delta Scuti stars,
RR Lyraes, Cepheids, Type II Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and long-period
variables (i.e. superclasses), and their subclasses (e.g. RR Lyrae ab, c, d,
and e types) using well-sampled light curves from any astronomical time-series
surveys in optical bands regardless of their survey-specific characteristics
such as color, magnitude, sampling rate, etc
