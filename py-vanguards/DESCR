Even after deployment of the new v3 onion service protocol the
attacks facing onion services are wide-ranging, and still require
more extensive modifications to fix in Tor-core itself.

Because of this, we have decided to rapid-prototype these defenses
in a controller addon in order to make them available ahead of
their official Tor-core release, for onion services that require
high security as soon as possible.
