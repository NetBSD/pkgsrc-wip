# wasabi: A lightweight console printing and formatting toolkit

Over the years, I've written countless implementations of coloring and
formatting utilities to output messages in our libraries like
[spaCy](https://spacy.io), [Thinc](https://github.com/explosion/thinc) and
[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy). While there are many other great open-source
options, I've always ended up wanting something slightly different or slightly
custom.

This package is still a work in progress and aims to bundle those utilities in a
standardised way so they can be shared across our other projects. It's super
lightweight, has zero dependencies and works across Python 2 and 3.
