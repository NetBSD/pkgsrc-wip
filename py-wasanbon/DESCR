wasanbon is a framework for Robotic Software Developers with Robotic
Technology Middleware (RT-middleware).

Robotic Technology Middleware is a standard for Robotic Softwares. In RTM,
each software element (like actuator, sensor, algorithm, and so on) is regarded
as Robotic Technology Component (RTC). Using RTM, developers can create
their robot software with constructing of those software components.

Each RTC has ports as data-trasnporting endpoints, and a statemachine.
To construct RT-system, connection between ports, and state activation is
indispensable. To launch multiple RTCs also disturbs developers. wasanbon
automates multiple RTC development in some aspects
