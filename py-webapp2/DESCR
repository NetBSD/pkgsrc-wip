`webapp2`_ is a lightweight Python web framework compatible with Google App
Engine's `webapp`_.

webapp2 is `simple`_. it follows the simplicity of webapp, but
improves it in some ways: it adds better URI routing and exception handling,
a full featured response object and a more flexible dispatching mechanism.

webapp2 also offers the package `webapp2_extras`_ with several optional
utilities: sessions, localization, internationalization, domain and subdomain
routing, secure cookies and others.

webapp2 can also be used outside of Google App Engine, independently of the
App Engine SDK
