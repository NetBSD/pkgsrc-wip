webapp3 is simple. it follows the simplicity of webapp, but improves it in some
ways: it adds better URI routing and exception handling, a full featured
response object and a more flexible dispatching mechanism.

webapp3 also offers the package webapp3_extras with several optional
utilities: sessions, localization, internationalization, domain and subdomain
routing, secure cookies and others.

webapp3 can also be used outside of Google App Engine, independently
of the App Engine SDK.
