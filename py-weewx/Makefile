# weewx 4.x had code and data in the same dir, and setup.py install
# would merge config file changes.  weewx 5.x does not appear to do
# this, and the user is left to manually adjust or not, as is the
# usual custom.  This comment is a caution that the config file
# behavior is not entirely understood.  This also applies to skins.
