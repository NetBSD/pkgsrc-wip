This package is useful in wip, and awkward to hoist to pkgsrc.

  - Consider installing an rc.d script.

  - Issues best addressed upstream, not really about the package.
    - Put "schema" under a weewx namespace; it's awkward at site-packages top level.
    - Install examples in examples.
    - Don't have weectl station put examples in user config dir

  - Consider an option for py-requests (needed for some drivers).  But
    really people can just install it.
