Testing a WSGI application sometimes involves starting
a server at a local host and port, then pointing your
test code to that address. Instead, this library lets
you intercept calls to any specific host/port
combination and redirect them into a WSGI application
importable by your test program. Thus, you can avoid
spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app
