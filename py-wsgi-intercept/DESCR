Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host
and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect
them into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you
can avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
