The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a standard interface
between web server software and web applications written in Python.
Having a standard interface makes it easy to use an application
that supports WSGI with a number of different web servers

wsgiref is a reference implementation of the WSGI specification that can
be used to add WSGI support to a web server or framework. It also contains
some useful utilities for writing applications or middleware that provide
or implement WSGI
