This module provides functions for wavenumber calibration of Raman
spectrometers. Currently it works only with binary SPE files, produced,
for example, by winspec (Princeton Instruments software). Supported
substances so far are polystyrene and cyclohexan (or any other,
if you have a table with Raman shifts and 15 minutes of time).
