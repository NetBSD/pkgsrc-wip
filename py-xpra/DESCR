Xpra is 'screen for X', and more: it allows you to run X programs,
usually on a remote host and direct their display to your local
machine. It also allows you to display existing desktop sessions
remotely.  Xpra is "rootless" or "seamless", and sessions can be
accessed over SSH, or password protected and encrypted over plain
TCP sockets.  Xpra adapts to bandwidth constraints and is fully
open-source.
