Yapps (Yet Another Python Parser System) is an easy to use parser generator that
is written in Python and generates Python code. Although there are several
parser generators already available for Python, I had different goals, including
learning about recursive descent parsers. Yapps is simple, is easy to use, and
produces human-readable parsers. It is not the fastest, most powerful, or most
flexible parser.
