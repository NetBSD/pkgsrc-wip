# yt-dlp-ejs

External JavaScript for yt-dlp supporting many runtimes

## Manual Installation

Install ejs into the same environment as yt-dlp:

```console
pip install -U yt-dlp-ejs
```

## Development

While this project does pin its dependencies,
it only provides a lockfile for building with `deno`.
You may install dependencies using any compatible package manager.
If you notice differences between different runtimes' builds
please open an issue [here](<https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs/issues/new>).
