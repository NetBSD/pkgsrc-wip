Zulip Terminal is the official terminal client for Zulip, providing
a text-based user interface (TUI).

Specific aims include:

* Providing a broadly similar user experience to the Zulip web
  client, ultimately supporting all of its features
* Enabling all actions to be achieved through the keyboard (see
  Hot keys)
* Exploring alternative user interface designs suited to the display
  and input constraints
* Supporting a wide range of platforms and terminal emulators
* Making best use of available rows/columns to scale from 80x24
  upwards (see Small terminal notes)
