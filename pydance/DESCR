pydance lets you play Dance Dance Revolution and similar games on your
computer, either with the keyboard or with a custom controller. What you
do is watch the screen as colored arrows move up the screen. As soon
as they cover up stationary arrows at the top, you step (or press) the
corresponding direction, in time with the beat of the music.

You don't need a dance mat to play pydance! It's a lot more fun if you
do, but you can also use your keyboard or gamepad.
