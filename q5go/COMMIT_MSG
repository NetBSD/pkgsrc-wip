Update prepared in wip by Aicaya Maro.

Packaging changes:
 * Install desktop file and icon.

Upstream changes:

 => 2.1.3 (2022-05-04)

This is a minor update. The two most visible changes are an added
autoplay feature for viewing SGF files, and more support for KataGo's
ruleset feature.

 => 2.1.2 (2021-07-12)

This is a bugfix release to fix an issue when saving SGF files in
locales where a comma is used instead of a decimal point.

 => 2.1.1 (2021-04-11)

This is a minor update to version 2.1 to also allow the maximum board
size in AI vs AI play.

 => 2.1 (2021-04-02)

This is primarily a relatively small bugfix release. These are the major
user-visible changes in 2.1:

 * A number of crashes in odd situations were fixed (such as analyzing
   games with komi values like 650, or handling invalid server messages).
 * It is now possible to copy/paste positions in Edit mode.
 * The batch analysis dialog has a new button to enqueue an entire
   directory of SGF files.
 * Engine games now allow board sizes up to 52.

 => 2.0 (2020-10-14)

These are the major user-visible changes in 2.0:

 * Pattern search is now available, similar to Kombilo. Use the settings
   dialog to create a suitable database. Unfortunately existing Kombilo
   databases can't be used for this because of 32/64 bit compatibility
   issues.
 * Database load times are reduced, and threading was added so that the
   user interface remains responsive.
 * Multiple online games can now be observed in a single window with
   clickable previews to switch between them. The old mode of one game
   per window is still available.
 * There is a new "Tip of the day" dialog on startup, which displays
   features that are maybe not easily discoverable. It can be disabled.
 * There are several new high resolution wood textures for the board to
   choose from.
 * When playing engines that are capable of analysis, the evaluation is
   now collected during the game and can be displayed live.
 * Engine configuration now allows engines to be unrestricted in board
   size and komi, catching up with improvements in KataGo over Leela
   Zero.
 * Some GTP bugs were fixed, which may improve compatibility with certain
   engines.
 * Window titles can now be overriden in the settings, which should help
   with streaming setups.
 * Performance improvements for the screen updates should now make it
   feasible to turn off quiet mode when online, which allows the server
   to send live player and game updates.
 * There is a new option to highlight the user's own chat messages in a
   different color.
