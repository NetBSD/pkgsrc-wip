This is a tool for Go players which performs the following functions:

* SGF editor
* Analysis frontend for KataGo, Leela Zero or compatible engines
* GTP interface
* IGS client
* Export to a variety of formats

The basic goal for this program is to provide an everyday SGF editor
that is fast, easy and convenient to use and does everything you
could want out of such a tool. Some of the more unusual features
include a Go diagram exporting function for sites like lifein19x19.com
or Sensei's library, as well as SVG vector graphics or slide export.
q5go also supports some non-standard Go variants. For beginners,
tutorials that explain the rules and basic tactics are included.

This program is based on the old Qt3 version of qGo, but ported to
Qt5 and modernized.
