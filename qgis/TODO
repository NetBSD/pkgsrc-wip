This package is now (mostly?) modifications for building on macOS as
well as some cleanups.

  - Add comments somehow about the big picture of approach on macOS.
    (Disabling "unix" on mac, if we are treating mac as unix, does not
    seem right.)

  - File bugs and/or discuss upstream.  Are we fixing a bug?  Making a
    fundamentally different choice?  What is the long-term plan?

  - For changes (relative to pkgsrc) not about macOS,
    patch-comments/upstream-reports.

  - For patches unchanged from pkgsrc, patrol for good enough comments
    and upstream bugs.

  - COMMIT_MSG

  - Test
