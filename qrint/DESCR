QRINT is a suite of Fortran 77 codes that approximates the orthogonal factor Q
in the QR factorization of a fundamental matrix solution (or part thereof) of a
linear system. The codes integrate the differential equations defining
the factor Q by representing Q as product of elementary Householder reflectors
or Givens rotations
