This is a QT Wrapper for OpenZWave and contains ozwdaemon --- a
service that allows you to remotely manage a Z-Wave Network via
ozw-admin or connect to a MQTT Broker.

(The upstream README is hard to understand; for now this package
should be expected to contain ozwdaemon, which is a bridge to MQTT to
enable access by Home Assistant.)
