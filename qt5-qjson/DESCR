JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of
value, and a collection of name/value pairs.

QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects: JSON
arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON objects will
be mapped to QVariantMap.
