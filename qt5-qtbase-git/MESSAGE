To allow this package to coexist with other versions of Qt
it has been installed in ${PREFIX}/qt5/{bin,include,lib,doc} etc.

You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by ensuring that

1) QTDIR is set to ${PREFIX}/qt5

2) Use the "configure" argument "--with-qt-dir=${PREFIX}/qt5"

3) Use the "cmake" argument "-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=${PREFIX}/qt5"

4) you may also have to put ${PREFIX}/qt5/bin in your PATH
