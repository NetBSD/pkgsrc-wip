Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program based onQucs circuit simulator.The
"S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of the Qucs-S project is to use
free circuit simulation kernels (Ngspice, Qucsator, Xyce) with the unified
GUI based on Qt6 toolkit. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity
of the Qucs GUI. Qucs-S is not a simulator by itself, but it requires to
use an external simulation backend with it. Qucs-S allows to use the
following open-source simulation kernels:

    Ngspice is recommended to use. Ngspice is powerful mixed-level/mixed-signal
    circuit simulator. The most of industrial SPICE models are compatible with
    Ngspice.
    XYCE is a new SPICE-compatible circuit simulator written by Sandia from
    the scratch.
    QucsatorRF for RF and microwave circuits design. It provides advanced
    models for such devices microstrip lines and waveguides. QucsatorRF
    is not SPICE compatible.
    SpiceOpus is developed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the
    Ljubljana University. It based on the SPICE-3f5 code
