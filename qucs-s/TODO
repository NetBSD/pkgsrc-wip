This is my first attempt making a pkgsrc-wip package. It appears to work but
not sure about the dependencies. It needs to be tested and revised but it 
is a good starting point.


  * Determine language variants of C and C++ that are needed and
    encode them.  Check if the package adds --std, and if not file a
    bug upstream and add FORCE_CXX_STD.
  - File a bug upstream about CMAKE_MANDIR (or whatever it actually is
    called) not being respected; add URL to one of the patchfiles.
  - Fix DESCR (looks like cut/paste from html with mangling; should be clean UTF-8)
  - Add desktopdb.mk
  - Sort bl3, or comment why not
  - USE_TOOLS probably doesn't need cmake, given build.mk
  - Add comment about bison define; seems like it shouldn't be needed,
    perhaps upstream bug.
  - Adjust comment to match DESCR - is this the spice version?
  - Clarify in DESCR if this includes spice or expects it to be
    external, and if so, if it's a dependency.  The actual situatio is
    probably ok, but hard to follow.  Are there other qucs-foo
    distributions?
  - Perhaps add a comment about cups, and that cups-libs is
    intentionally not a dependency.  (This is not required by our
    norms, but is gdt opinion about documented code to help the next
    maintainer.)
      Could NOT find Cups (missing: CUPS_LIBRARIES CUPS_INCLUDE_DIR)
  - Perhaps understand, report upstream, or fix:
      [175/798] Generating ui_searchdialog.h
      Detected locale "C" with character encoding "646", which is not UTF-8.
      Qt depends on a UTF-8 locale, and has switched to "C.UTF-8" instead.
      If this causes problems, reconfigure your locale. See the locale(1) manual
      for more information.
  - Finish COMMIT_MSG, with version and at least a few lines from DESCR.
