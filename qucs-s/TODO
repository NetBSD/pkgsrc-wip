This is my first attempt making a pkgsrc-wip package. It appears
to work but not sure about the dependencies. It needs to be tested
and revised but it is a good starting point. Some missing points:


  * Determine language variants of C and C++ that are needed and
    encode them.  Check if the package adds --std, and if not file
    a bug upstream and add FORCE_CXX_STD.  Asked upstream for
    standard C and C++ requirements. In the meantime FORCE_CXX_STD=
    gnu++20 is used.

  - File a bug upstream about CMAKE_MANDIR (or whatever it actually
    is called) not being respected; add URL to one of the patchfiles.
    Waiting fo upstream feedback.  - Add comment about bison define;
    seems like it shouldn't be needed, perhaps upstream bug. This
    need to be investigated.

  - Perhaps add a comment about cups, and that cups-libs is
    intentionally not a dependency.  (This is not required by our
    norms, but is gdt opinion about documented code to help the
    next maintainer.)
      Could NOT find Cups (missing: CUPS_LIBRARIES CUPS_INCLUDE_DIR)

  - Perhaps understand, report upstream, or fix:
      [175/798] Generating ui_searchdialog.h Detected locale "C"
      with character encoding "646", which is not UTF-8.  Qt depends
      on a UTF-8 locale, and has switched to "C.UTF-8" instead.
      If this causes problems, reconfigure your locale. See the
      locale(1) manual for more information.
