This is a Video + Audio player along the lines of mplayer. It's simple
yet decent looking. It finds album art for you for music files,
generates thumbnails for videos so you can select logaction by
thumbnail and more. It accepts file lists on the cmdline ala:

  rage file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.avi file4.mp4 file5.ogg
  rage dvd:/
  rage http://www.blah.com/stream

You can also specify subtitle files with -sub:
