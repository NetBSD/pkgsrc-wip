Ratproxy is a semi-automated, largely passive web application security
audit tool. It is meant to complement active crawlers and manual proxies
more commonly used for this task, and is optimized specifically for an
accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential
problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the observation
of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0 environments.
The approach taken with ratproxy offers several important advantages over
more traditional methods; please consult ratproxy's home page or the
installed README file for more information.
