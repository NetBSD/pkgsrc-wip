rawdog is a feed aggregator, capable of producing a personal "river of
news" or a public "planet" page. It supports all common feed formats,
including all versions of RSS and Atom. By default, it is run from cron,
collects articles from a number of feeds, and generates a static HTML
page listing the newest articles in date order. It supports per-feed
customizable update times, and uses ETags, Last-Modified, gzip
compression, and RFC3229+feed to minimize network bandwidth usage. Its
behaviour is highly customisable using plugins written in Python.
