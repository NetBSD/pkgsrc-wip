This is an unofficial command line client for Bitwarden.
Although it does come with its own command line client, this client is
limited by being stateless - to use it, you're required to manually lock and
unlock the client, and pass the temporary keys around in environment variables,
which makes it very difficult to use. This client avoids this problem by
maintaining a background process which is able to hold the keys in memory,
similar to the way that ssh-agent or gpg-agent work. This allows the client
to be used in a much simpler way, with the background agent taking care of
maintaining the necessary state.

I consider rbw to be essentially feature-complete for me at this point. While
I still use it on a daily basis, and will continue to fix regressions as they
occur, I am unlikely to spend time implementing new features on my own. If you
would like to see new functionality in rbw, I am more than happy to review
and merge pull requests implementing those features.
