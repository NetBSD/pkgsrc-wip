RealVNC 4.0 is the new version of the "original" VNC software

From www.realvnc.com:
VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is remote control software
which allows you to view and interact with one computer (the "server")
using a simple program (the "viewer") on another computer anywhere on the
Internet. The two computers don't even have to be the same type, so for
example you can use VNC to view an office Linux machine on your Windows PC
at home. VNC is freely and publicly available and is in widespread active
use by millions throughout industry, academia and privately.
