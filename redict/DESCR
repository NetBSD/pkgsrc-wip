Redict is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached but the
dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached,
but also lists, sets, and ordered sets. All these data types can be manipulated
with atomic operations to push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform
server side union, intersection, and difference between sets, and so forth.
Redict also supports different kinds of sorting.

Redict 7.3.0 is a fork of and is broadly compatible with Redis 7.2.4. The
following notable changes are included:

 * The name has been updated throughout the software from "redis" to "redict".
   As a result, for example, redis-server is now redict-server.
 * The Lua API global has been renamed to "redict". "redis" is an alias for
   this for backwards compatibility.
 * The Modules API symbols have been renamed to RedictModule. Modules are
   binary compatible with Redis Modules targetting Redis 7.2.4.
