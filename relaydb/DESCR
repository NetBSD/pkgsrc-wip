relaydb is a mail header analyzer that builds a database of IP addresses
either known as legitimate senders or spammers.

relaydb doesn't itself classify mails as legitimate or spam, that decision
needs to be reached through other means.  Neither does relaydb block spam
itself.  It merely provides a list of IP addresses to block through other
means, like spamd(8) and pf(4).
