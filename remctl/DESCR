remctl (the client) and remctld (the server) implement a client/server
protocol for running single commands on a remote host using Kerberos
v5 authentication and returning the output. They use a very simple
GSSAPI-authenticated network protocol, combined with server-side ACL
support and a server configuration file that maps remctl commands to
programs that should be run when that command is called by an
authorized user. remctld is very similar to a CGI server that uses a
different network protocol than HTTP and always does strong
authentication before executing the desired command.
