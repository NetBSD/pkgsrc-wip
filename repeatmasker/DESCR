RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed
repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is
a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query
sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which
all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by
Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by the program
cross_match, an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh
algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed by Warren
Gish.
