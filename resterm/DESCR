Resterm is a terminal-first client for working with HTTP, GraphQL,
and gRPC services. No cloud sync, no signups, no heavy desktop app.
Simple, yet feature rich, terminal client for .http/.rest files.
It pairs a Vim-like-style editor with a workspace explorer, response
diff, history, profiler and scripting so you can iterate on requests
without leaving the keyboard.
