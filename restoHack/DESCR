restoHack is a modern resurrection of Hack, the legendary 1984
roguelike that paved the way for NetHack. This isn't a reimagining.
This is preservation with a blowtorch and a scalpel.  The goal:
get the original code compiling, running, and dungeon-crawling like
it did back when floppy disks were king, but on a 2025 toolchain.

Think of it as a resto-mod. The soul stays vintage. The internals?
Cleaned, modernized, and ready to play in 2025.
