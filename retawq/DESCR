retawq is an interactive, multi-threaded network client (web browser) for text
terminals on computers with Unix-like operating systems. It is written in C,
fast, small, nicely configurable, and comfortable; e.g. the low-level network
communications are performed in a non-blocking way, and you can keep open as
many "virtual windows" as you want and work simultaneously in two of them in a
split-screen mode.
