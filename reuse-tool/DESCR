Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from
different projects that are released under various different licenses.

REUSE was started by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) to provide a
set of recommendations to make licensing your Free Software projects easier.
Not only do these recommendations make it easier for you to declare the
licenses under which your works are released, but they also make it easier
for a computer to understand how your project is licensed.

As a short summary, the recommendations are threefold:
- Choose and provide licenses
- Add copyright and licensing information to each file
- Confirm REUSE compliance

This tool exists to facilitate the developer in complying with the above
recommendations.
