Anonymous metadata-resistant instant messaging that just works.

Ricochet is an experimental kind of instant messaging that doesn't
trust anyone with your identity, your contact list, or your
communications.

* You can chat without exposing your identity (or IP address) to
  anyone
* Nobody can discover who your contacts are or when you talk
  (metadata-free!)
* There are no servers or operators that could be compromised,
  exposing your information.
* It's cross-platform and easy for non-technical users.
