rga: ripgrep, but also search in PDFs, E-Books, Office documents, zip, tar.gz,
etc.

rga is a line-oriented search tool that allows you to look for a regex in a
multitude of file types. rga wraps the awesome ripgrep and enables it to search
in pdf, docx, sqlite, jpg, movie subtitles (mkv, mp4), etc.

rga will recursively descend into archives and match text in every file type it
knows.
