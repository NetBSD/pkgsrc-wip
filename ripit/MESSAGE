ripit can use a number of different programs to do the actual track
extraction and audio encoding. By default ripit uses cdparanoia and
oggenc respectively, so this port depends on those two having been
installed. If you want ripit to use other helper utils, such as lame, just
install them and tell ripit which ones to use.
