Ripple peer-to-peer network daemon.
Ripple is a peer-to-peer payment system created by Ripple Labs Inc. Ripple lets
you easily, cheaply, and safely send money over the Internet to anyone, anywhere
in the world. Anyone can create an account. Because Ripple is P2P software, no
individual, corporation, or government controls it. The network operates via the
combined effort of the Ripple software running all over the world.
