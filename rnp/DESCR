"rnp" is a set of OpenPGP (RFC4880) tools that works on Linux, *BSD and macOS
as a replacement of GnuPG. It is maintained by Ribose after being forked from
NetPGP, itself originally written for NetBSD.

"librnp" is the library used by rnp for all OpenPGP functions, useful for
developers to build against. Thanks to Alistair, it is a "real" library, not a
wrapper like GPGME of GnuPG.
