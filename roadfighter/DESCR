In Road Fighter you drive a car in a death race between you and a group
of mad drivers. Your aim? To reach the end of the checkpoint before you
run out of fuel. Sounds easy? Far from it, there's a lot of obstacles
between your car and the checkpoints! The game is divided in 6 stages
and features 3 different difficulty levels:

 GAME A is for beginners. You will want to choose this when you play the game
 for the first time.

 GAME B is for advanced players. The game is quite hard to finish in this mode.

 GAME C is for crazy players. In this mode you will have serious problems to
 beat the game!

During the race, you should try not to hit the borders of the road.
Beware of the other cars, because they sometimes will try to push you
to the border and make you crash. Another important issue is the fuel.
You should try to collect all the fuel recharges that you can during
the game. They are represented by the pink hearts.

You can also play the game with 2 players at the same time in split screen mode!
