rofi: update to 1.7.8

1.7.1: Turtley amazing!
This release focusses on fixing bugs found in 1.7.0.
The most important ones are fixing sizing bug, fix nested
media statements and broken close-on-delete. There are a
few new features to help themeing:
We now support env(ENV,default) statement and when dumping
a theme theme-names are resolved (f.e. green, lightblue, etc.).

1.7.2: Shellebrations!
A quick in between release, a bug got fixed that caused
configurations not working any more in theme files. While
this is the desired behaviour, this release reverts it to
avoid breaking to many setups.

1.7.3: Sturtled!
A small intermediate release with a few fixes, mostly in
documentation and two great additions by Jakub Jiruta:
- An option to customize the combi mode display format.
- To possibility to set tab stops on listview and entry boxes.

1.7.4: Preshellected Optimizations
Another maintenance and small features expansion release.
A lot of small annoyances have been fixed and ignored errors
are now more visually flagged to the user. In the past typos
in the theme could result into broken themes without any
warning to the user (except in debug mode), if an unknown link
is found it will now throw an error. To help the user find the
right documentation, the manpages are further split up into
sub-pages and are expanded.
Another improvement made that can have huge impact on the
user-experience is a significant speedup in the async input
reading of dmenu. It turned out glib's GInputStream async
methods are very slow. On large input sets where it was
supposed to improve the user experience, it made it unusable.
To resolve this a custom implementation has been made.
Background loading is now close to the same speed as loading
at start before displaying. A million item list is now near
instant. On very large lists, the instant filtering
automatically changes to be postponed until the user stops
typing. This severely reduces system load and interface blocking.
A few long standing feature requests and bug reports have been
implemented or fixed:
- Listview flow. You can now change the flow in the listview
from vertical first to horizontal first. Making it mimic tables.
- You can set a custom fallback icon for each mode.
- In dmenu mode (and script) you can now make (some) changes to
the theme, for example modifying the background color of the
entry box.
- User scripts (for script mode) into $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rofi/scripts
directory are automatically available in rofi.
- You can now render text as icons, this allows you to use glyphs
icon fonts as icons.
- Hide listview when unfiltered. (#1079)
- You can now add a separate icon or textbox widget to the UI that
displays the current selected item. As an example see the included
sidebar-v2.
- A bug was fixed that caused problems with newer xkeyboard-config
versions and different keyboard layouts.

1.7.5: We shell overcome
A quick bug-fix release to fix 2 small issues.
- In DMenu sync mode, the separator is left in the string.
- On special crafted delayed input in dmenu it shows updates to the
list very slow. It now forces to push update (if there) every 1/10
of a second.
- In the view some of the update/redraw policies are fixed to reduced
the perceived delay.

1.7.6: Traveling Time
- Recursive file browser
- Copy to clipboard support
- Entry box history
- Fix calc
- Text and cursor outline
- In this version, we have bumped the minimal required versions of
some dependencies to keep up with bugs and deprecations while staying
compatible with long-term supported distributions.
Known issues:
- new-selection is not working for values exceeding the number of rows
in previous run. (#2037)
Other smaller changes:
- new .rasinc extension for theme fragments included from other theme files

or end to control how long entries are ellipsized

- -window-prefer-icon-theme to force precedence of theme icons over
applications' custom ones (#1702)
- -placeholder-markup to enable pango markup when rendering placeholder
text (#1690)

script modes

transient to the currently focused window.

Ortango #1969)
