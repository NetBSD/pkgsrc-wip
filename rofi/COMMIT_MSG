x11/rofi: update to 2.0.0

* 2.0.0
In this release we merged back lbonn his great wayland port of rofi into mainline.
Wayland is now an officially supported backend.

With the merge of the wayland backend, for ease of maintenance, we dropped the
autotools build system. We now only support the meson build system.

You can build rofi with only X11 or Wayland. It also supports or both backends
enabled, where it automatically select the right backend.

To help bug reports, we added the command rofi -info.
This will print the selected backends. Compilation options, loaded plugins,
scripts and more.

Known issues:

With wayland, rofi only knows after the first surface is drawn, what the dpi and
scale is. Because of this, it might need to redraw/resize elements (icons/text)
after displaying. This can generate a weird 'flicker' on startup. It will first
load a lower resolution version of the icons (that the window manager scales
up), then it gets updated with the real resolution and it then loads full
resolution icons. Because icon loading is asynchronous, they will disappear and
re-appear. Issue: #2165

It is currently not possible, in a reliable way, to detect out of window clicks.
So under wayland this feature currently does not work. Issue: #2158
