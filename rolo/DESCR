Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a
text-based menu.  Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for
complimenting text-based email programs-such as mutt.  It utilizes
the vCard version 3.0 format for storing its contacts and it
interfaces with the end-user through a NCurses front-end.

Rolo is written in ANSI C and uses Automake and Autoconf to manage
its build system.  Rolo makes uses of the NCurses library and the
menu library that compliments NCurses.  It has been developed and
tested thoroughly on FreeBSD, but the code was designed to be as
non-platform specific as possible.
