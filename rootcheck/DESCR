Rootcheck is an open source rootkit detection software. It scans the whole
system looking for known rootkits and also for the presence of unknown
rootkits and kernel level ones using anomaly detection.

Rootcheck is also integrated with the OSSEC HIDS, providing a powerful
host-based IDS solution. It includes log analysis, file integrity change
detection and rootkit detection (all in one simple to use package).
