To use the Rosegarden sequencer with aRts support, artsd must be running
before rosegarden is started or the sequencer will fail to start.

To use MIDI devices via aRts, run artscontrol (this will launch artsd if
necessary). Select MIDI Manager from the View menu. Register one or more
of your raw MIDI nodes (e.g. /dev/rmidi0) with Add / System MIDI Port.

Next start rosegarden; in the MIDI Manager you will see a Rosegarden Play
client register itself as a MIDI input, and a Rosegarden Record client as
a MIDI output. Use the MIDI manager to connect the play client to one or
more outputs, and/or connect the record client to one or more inputs.

As the Rosegarden aRts driver creates but one play client, you are limited
to 16 MIDI channels of independent output. Although you can connect the
single play client to multiple MIDI outputs, you cannot drive multiple
MIDI outputs simultaneously (without hacking ArtsDriver to make more than
one client).
