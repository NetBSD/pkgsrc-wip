roswell: added version 23.10.14.114

Roswell is a Lisp implementation installer/manager, launcher, and
much more! It started out as a command-line tool with the aim to make
installing and managing Common Lisp implementations really simple
and easy. It has now evolved into a full-stack environment for Common
Lisp development, and has many features that makes it easy to test,
share, and distribute your Lisp applications.  With Roswell, we
aim to push the Common Lisp community to a whole new level of
productivity. While technically still in beta, the basic interfaces
are stable and not likely to change.
