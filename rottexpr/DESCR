This source port of Rise of the Triad features the following:

 - Now runs off of SDL2!
 - Support for resolutions from 320x200 all the way to 3840x2160
 - Adaptive HUD positioning (no more status bar being off to the side)
 - HUD scaling (HUD scaling for bottomless HUD coming later)
 - Support for bordered and borderless windowed modes

New gameplay options:

 * Blitzguards being outfitted with any weapon from the missile/magic weapon
   arsenal! Yes, that means Blitzguards can use excalibats too!
 * You can now pick up ammo from dropped missile weapons!
 * A special respawning enemy game mode called ZomROTT, where you have to gib
   your enemies to keep them from coming back!
