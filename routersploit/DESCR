The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework dedicated to
embedded devices.

It consists of various modules that aids penetration testing operations:

 - exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
 - creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services
 - scanners - modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit
 - payloads - modules that are responsible for generating payloads for
	      various architectures and injection points
 - generic - modules that perform generic attacks
