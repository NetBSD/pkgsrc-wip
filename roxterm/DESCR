ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features
to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library. It was originally
designed to have a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time by
not using the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to
provide the configuration GUI, but thanks to all the features it's
acquired over the years ROXTerm can probably now be accused of
bloat. However, it is more configurable than gnome-terminal and
aimed more at "power" users who make heavy use of terminals.
