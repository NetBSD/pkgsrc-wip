rPGP is the only pure Rust implementation of OpenPGP, following RFC4880 and
RFC2440. It offers a minimal low-level API and does not prescribe trust schemes
or key management policies. It fully supports all functionality required by the
Autocrypt 1.1 e-mail encryption specification.

rPGP is regularly published as the pgp Crate and its RSA implementation lives
under the collective RustCrypto umbrella. For ECC crypto support we are using
Curve25519-dalek.
