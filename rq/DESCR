rq (Rego Query) is inspired by jq, and aims to offer a similar set of
capabilities oriented around running Rego queries. In the long run, rq
is intended to make it as easy as possible to utilize Rego both
interactively as a shell command, and within shell scripts. Though it
is already possible to use Rego in this way with via opa eval using the
official opa command, rq is intended to be easier and simpler to use
specifically in a shell context, and has additional convenience
features to support this use case, such as more input and output
formats, syntax highlighted output, and so on.
