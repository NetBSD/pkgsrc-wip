Remote Staging Execution Tool

rset(1) operates by staging files on a remote system, then executing
instructions embedded in the pln(5) files. Any interpreter capable of running
scripts read over a pipe may be specified.

The bundled utilities rinstall(1) and rsub(1) provide an easy means of
installing and modifying configuration files, and capabilities are added by
writing utility scripts which are sent along with configuration data.
