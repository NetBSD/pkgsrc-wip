This package provides two programs:

rsd -		The server which PCM data is streamed to over TCP/IP or Unix
		domain sockets, Sound is played back with a low latency
		depending on what backend is used. It supports several
		connections to be played back at the same time.

rsdplay -	The client which streams PCM data recieved from stdin to a
		rsoundserv. The code in rsdplay is mostly for reference.
