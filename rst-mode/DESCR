reStructuredText is a series of conventions that allows a toolset--docutils--to
extract generic document structure from simple text files. For people who use
Emacs, there is a package that adds a major mode that supports editing in the
conventions of reStructuredText: rst.el. This document describes the features it
provides, and how to setup your emacs to use them and how to invoke them.
