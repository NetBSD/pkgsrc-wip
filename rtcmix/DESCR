RTcmix is a real-time software "language" for doing digital sound
synthesis and signal-processing. It is written in C/C++, and is
distributed open-source, free of charge. In certain respects, it
is similar in function to other extant unit-generator-based software
languages such as CSOUND, SuperCollider and (to a lesser extent)
JSyn and Max/MSP -- they do share a common heritage, after all.
There are some differences, however, between all these languages...
and variety is of course the spice of life!

So if you've been searching the web high and low for just the right
library of DSP functions to include in your latest&greatest "killer"
(or maybe "peacefully coexisting"?) app, then RTcmix may just be
the Right Package for You.
