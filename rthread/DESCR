Python standard library contains thread library which provides
primitives for writing multi-threaded programs. There are primitives
for locks (allocating, acquiring and releasing), getting an
identification of the thread, raising an exception in the main thread
and, most importantly, start_new_thread function for starting a new
thread.

rthread library introduced here mimics the interface of
thread to some extent. The objective is to make distributed
computing look and feel similar to multi-threaded programming
