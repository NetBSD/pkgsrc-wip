- If curses(3) is used on NetBSD it will be probably problematic because a
  subwindow could not contain another subwindow.
  To reproduce that:

    | import curses
    | 
    | stdscr = curses.initscr()
    | subwin = stdscr.derwin(0, 0, 0, 0)
    | subsubwin = subwin.derwin(0, 0, 0, 0)

  <roy> fixed that via src/lib/libcurses/newwin.c,r1.15 but is not in netbsd-8.
  Should we request a pullup for it?

- Colors don't seem to work on NetBSD when built with curses(3) (it's just
  mostly monochrome despite using the `default' theme).
  Investigate why that happens and if possible fix that.

  As a possible workaround please use `--monochrome' option.

- This package has known vulnerabilities, please investigate and fix if possible:
   CVE-2017-17516

- Probably not worth to import: www/tuir - a maintained rtv fork - was
  imported (at the moment there is probably no real differences between
  the two and I am still using rtv)
