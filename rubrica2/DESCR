Rubrica is an addressbook manager for the GNOME Environment. It allows you to
add personal data (name, surname, address, etc.), web links, IRC and email
addresses, telephone numbers, job information (company where contact works,
company infos, contact's assigment, etc.) and notes.

XML is used to store the data. Rubrica can import/export addressbooks from/to
GnomeCard, KAddressbook, Evolution, and CSV file format. Can export addressboks
to HTML and text format.
