Ruby convenience framework for instant messaging.

Features
* Supports sending and receiving of messages, using an API inspired by Action
  Mailer
* Simple mocking out of message sending code, to make unit testing your
  messaging code almost trivial
* Configuration for the messengers separated from the code
* Ability to control multiple messengers, if you want, although a single
  messenger is much easier
