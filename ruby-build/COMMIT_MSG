devel/ruby-build: Add ruby-build version 20250610

Packaged in wip by Frédéric Fauberteau

ruby-build is a command-line tool that simplifies installation of any Ruby
version from source on Unix-like systems.

It is available as a plugin for [rbenv][] as the `rbenv install` command, or as
a standalone program as the `ruby-build` command.
