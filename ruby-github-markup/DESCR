This library is the first step of a journey that every markup file in
a repository goes on before it is rendered on GitHub.com:

    1. github-markup selects an underlying library to convert the raw
       markup to HTML. See the list of supported markup formats below.
    2. The HTML is sanitized, aggressively removing things that could
       harm you and your kin-such as script tags, inline-styles, and
       class or id attributes.
    3. Syntax highlighting is performed on code blocks. See
       github/linguist for more information about syntax highlighting.
    4. The HTML is passed through other filters that add special
       sauce, such as emoji, task lists, named anchors, CDN caching
       for images, and autolinking.
    5. The resulting HTML is rendered on GitHub.com.

Please note that only the first step is covered by this gem - the
rest happens on GitHub.com. In particular, markup itself does no
sanitization of the resulting HTML, as it expects that to be covered
by whatever pipeline is consuming the HTML.
