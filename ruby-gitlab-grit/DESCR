Grit gives you object oriented read/write access to Git repositories
via Ruby. The main goals are stability and performance. To this end,
some of the interactions with Git repositories are done by shelling
out to the system's git command, and other interactions are done with
pure Ruby reimplementations of core Git functionality. This choice,
however, is transparent to end users, and you need not know which
method is being used.

This software was developed to power GitHub, and should be considered
production ready. An extensive test suite is provided to verify its
correctness.

Original Grit is maintained by Tom Preston-Werner, Scott Chacon, Chris
Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.
