Ever needed to use a global variable in Rails? Ugh, that's the worst. If youq
need global state, you've probably reached for Thread.current. Like this:

    def self.foo
      Thread.current[:foo] ||= 0
    end

    def self.foo=(value)
      Thread.current[:foo] = value
    end

Ugh! I hate it. But you gotta do what you gotta do...
