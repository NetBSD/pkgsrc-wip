RunCPM is an application which can execute vintage CP/M 8-bit programs on many
modern platforms. It can be built both on 32- and 64-bit host environments and
should be easily portable to other platforms. RunCPM is fully written in C and
in a modular way, so porting to other platforms should be only a matter of
writing an abstraction layer file for it. No modification to the main code
modules should be necessary.

If you miss using powerful programs like Wordstar, dBaseII, mBasic and others,
then RunCPM is for you. RunCPM emulates CP/M 2.2 from Digital Research as close
as possible, the only difference being that it uses regular folders on the host
instead of disk images.
