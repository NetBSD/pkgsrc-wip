Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language. It
visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly
in syntactic and semantic details. Its design is oriented toward
concerns of "programming in the large", that is, of creating and
maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational - that
preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.

It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor,
object-oriented and pure functional styles. Rust also supports
generic programming and metaprogramming, in both static and dynamic
styles.
