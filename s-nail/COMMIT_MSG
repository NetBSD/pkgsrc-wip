s-nail: updated s-nail to 14.9.24

Update prepared in wip by Kevin Bloom.

Packaging updates:
- removed unneeded patch in favor of MAKE_FLAGS

14.9.23 -> 14.9.24:
- Release tarball might be in --format=pax
- Again honour MTA arguments passed after the "--" command line
  "option" in non-send-only mode (broken since at least v14.9.12).
- Support Microsoft IMAP servers.
- Fix crash due to crafted emails.
- Fix expandargv (broken since v14.9.0).
- Fix a bug from nail 10.08 as of 2004-06-28 that leads to
  crashes when some file cannot be loaded.
  And while here fix one file-close overshoot of mine in since
  v14.9.16, that would cause panics in debug-enabled code.
- Deal with argc==0 aka CVE-2021-4034.

14.9.22 -> 14.9.23;
- VAL_RANDOM=getentropy was broken.
- An unset mta-bcc-ok could cause partial Bcc: content
  to be written to Cc: or To:.
- Date offset calculation was wrong for timezones which use
  a negative adjustment for "is daylight saving time active".
- Continue searching MIME handler sources if the first found one
  is not applicable in current context.
- Fixed `vexpr' shift operators broken for "optimization".
- Fixed `date-utc' subcommand which used two "dutc_month"
  instead of one plus "dutc_day".
- Temporarily set an unset $LESS to portable "RI" not "RXi".
- A couple of SIGALARM / alarm(2) fixes for the -keepalive-
  variable series.
- We drop inherited effective IDs upon startup.
- mimeview now also asks for text/ parts whether an action
  shall be applied.  And if there is no plain part we may
  use the rich one if possible.
- pipe-TYPE/SUBTYPE now support type-markers.
