S2TC provides a subset of a wellknown texture compression scheme.
This package provides the library libtxc_dxtn which can be used by
grahics/MesaLib.

S2TC's format specification is very easy to implement, so it is
not hard to make a working compressor or decompressor for it. It
is based on Color Cell Compression[1] from 1986, and decoding is
done entirely using the methods from there. Encoding is done using
a search and refinement method that is derived from the methods
described in that paper.

The compressor and decompressor here are licensed under a license
that gives you all freedoms you will ever need (namely, the MIT
license). In particular, the MIT license allows you to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense or sell the software,
provided you keep copyright notices intact.
