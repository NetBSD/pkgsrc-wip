SafeKeep is a centralized and easy to use backup application that
combines the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup.
It sets up the appropriate environment for compatible backup packages
and simplifies the process of running them.

You will probably find SafeKeep useful if you:

    Run a Unix, and you need to backup your data,
    Prefer Open Source, and you are not willing to trust your
    valuable data to a closed, proprietary product,
    Demand Security, because it is not negotiable,
    Strive for Simplicity, because TCO matters.

If you feel SafeKeep may be the answer for your data backup needs,
take a few moments to see what it can offer. We've tried to make
it simple, secure, and manageable. We built it on top of solid open
source components that have been extensively tested by the community.
You can trust SafeKeep with your data.
