Sailor is based on chroot and pkgin, it will create a chrooted environment
containing only the needed pieces in order to install and / or run a service.
Note that sailor's goal is not to provide bullet-proof security,
chroot is definitely not a trustable isolator;
instead, sailor is a really convenient way of trying / testing an evironment
without compromising your workstation filesystem.
