- Upgrade to SARG version 2.0.8.

- Test, if it works with SquidGuard (I haven't installed this software).

- SARG doesn't sort index entries correctly in case if date format
  is an European. This is completely SARG issue (see index.c file
  for details - it insufficiently uses external sort(1) utility).
