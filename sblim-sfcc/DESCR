The small footprint CIM client library is a C API allowing client
applications to interface with CIM implementations (e.g., CIM
servers). Due to its small memory and disk footprint it is well-suited
for embedded environments.

SFCC provides a generic layer to load the underlying libraries to
communicate to the CIM server via 2 methods: http interface and
local connect interface.
