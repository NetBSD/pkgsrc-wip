Scare is a GPL ISO C implementation of an interpreter for interactive
fiction games written in Adrift.

Version 1.3 unites the improvements of later version 1.1 releases,
such as UNDO, with Thomas Payerle's support for Adrift 3.90 games
in version 1.2, and new support for Adrift 3.80 games, resulting
in a single open source Adrift runner that seamlessly plays Adrift
version 4.00, version 3.90, and version 3.80 games.

Version 1.3 is designed to be compatible with the Adrift Runner
version 4.00.42, with some version 4.00.44 features.  It automatically
converts Adrift version 3.90 and version 3.80 games into version
4.00 format before playing them.
