A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. Counts blank lines, comment lines,
and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

The goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO
calculations like sloccount and estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic
complexity calculators. In short, one tool to rule them all.
