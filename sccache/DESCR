sccache is a ccache-like compiler caching tool. It is used as a compiler
wrapper and avoids compilation when possible, storing cached results either on
local disk or in one of several cloud storage backends.

sccache includes support for caching the compilation of C/C++ code, Rust, as
well as NVIDIA's CUDA using nvcc.

sccache also provides icecream-style distributed compilation (automatic
packaging of local toolchains) for all supported compilers (including Rust).
The distributed compilation system includes several security features that
icecream lacks such as authentication, transport layer encryption, and
sandboxed compiler execution on build servers.
