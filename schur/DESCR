Schur is a stand alone C program for interactively calculating properties of Lie
groups and symmetric functions.Schur has been designed to answer questions of
relevance to a wide range of problems of special interest to chemists,
mathematicians and physicists particularly for persons who need specific
knowledge relating to some aspect of Lie groups or symmetric functions and yet
do not wish to be encumbered with complex algorithms. The objective of Schur is
to supply results with the complexity of the algorithms hidden from view so that
the user can effectively use Schur as a scratch pad, obtaining a result and then
using that result to derive new results in a fully interactive manner. Schur can
be used as a tool for calculating branching rules,  Kronecker products, Casimir
invariants, dimensions, plethysms, S-function operations, Young diagrams and
their hook lengths etc.
