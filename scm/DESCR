Scm is a portable Scheme implementation written in C including the
following features:
    * Conforms to Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme and
	the IEEE P1178 specification.
    * Support for SICP, R2RS, R3RS, and R5RS scheme code.
    * Supports inexact real and complex numbers, 30 bit immediate integers
	and large precision integers.
    * Supports many Common Lisp functions.
    * Char-code-limit, most-positive-fixnum, most-negative-fixnum, and
	internal-time-units-per-second constants. *Features* and
	*load-pathname* variables.
    * Arrays and bit-vectors. String ports and software emulation ports.
	I/O extensions providing ANSI C and POSIX.1 facilities.
    * Interfaces to standard libraries including REGEX string regular
	expression matching and the CURSES screen management package.
    * Available add-on packages including an interactive debugger, database,
	X-window graphics, BGI graphics, Motif, and Open-Windows packages.
    * A compiler (HOBBIT) and dynamic linking of compiled modules.
    * User definable responses to interrupts and errors,
	Process-syncronization primitives. Setable levels of monitoring
	and timing information printed interactively (the verbose function).
	Restart, quit, and exec.
