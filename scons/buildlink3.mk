# Note that while scons is a build tool, it requires running a python
# program on the host that uses the scons library.  Currently, the
# python version on the host and the version being used on the target
# for the package being built are linked.
# \todo Consider if this can be TOOL_DEPENDS (or TOOL), instead of buildlink.

# scons scripts (SConstruct) have a number of common problems,
# including not passing environment variables set by pkgsrc to
# invocations of the compiler.  See the
# /usr/pkgsrc/*/*/patch-SConstruct for typical remediations.
