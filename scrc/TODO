(1) Adjust scrc-2.1/Makefile.macros to support Linux and other OS.
(2) Fix the runtime problem 
    ERROR #3105: Semantic error in line 221
             in file "/usr/include/stdio.h":
             Declaration of symbol '__restrict'
             does not match former declaration:
             type mismatch (#2039).
    (on NetBSD/{i386,amd64} 5.x, probably gcc-4.1.x)

(3) See patches/patch-ag,
   -Wl,rpath ${SPECC_SLIB} doesn't seem to work so the work around 
   is on pathces/patch-ag
   to set LD_RUN_PATH at compile time, may not be hurtful, but rpath
   may be better

(4) This packages seems broken now wit:
