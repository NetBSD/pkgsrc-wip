"Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D point-and-click science fiction thriller set in a
bleak vision of the future, originally published for DOS and the Amiga. You are
Robert Foster, an innocent outsider stranded in a vast city where oppressed
civilians live and work in soaring tower blocks... whilst the corrupt, covetous
and rich live underground, safe from all pollution. Alone, save for a robot
circuit board, Foster must fight for survival - and discover the sinister truth
behind both his own past and the city he has found himself trapped in."
