sdd is a replacement for a program called 'dd'.

sdd is much faster than dd in cases where input block size (ibs) is not equal
to the output block size (obs).

Some features not found on 'dd':

- Statistics are much better readable as from 'dd'.
- rmt support for if= and of=.
- Output file is sync'd before doing statistics.
- Timing available (print transfer speed).
- Seek on input and output
- Fast null i/o.
- Progress bar.
