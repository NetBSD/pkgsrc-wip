By default, this package will use PAM for authentication purposes.
To add the required authenticaion policies to your PAM configuration,
import the policy files provided with the package:

	$ for i in sddm sddm-autologin sddm-greeter; do
	> cp @PREFIX@/share/examples/pam.d/$i /etc/pam.d
	> done

You will also need to install the sddm rc.d script to run it as a
service. These details will be noted during the installation phase.
