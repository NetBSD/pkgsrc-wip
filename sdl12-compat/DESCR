This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low level
access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D
framebuffer across multiple platforms.

This code is a compatibility layer; it provides a binary and source compatible
API for programs written against SDL 1.2, but it uses SDL 2.0 behind the
scenes. If you are writing new code, please target SDL 2.0 directly and do
not use this layer.
