Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system with
advanced support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Collection of files are called libraries and each library can be
synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen
password. The password is not stored on the server so even the
server admin cannot view your file contents.

Seafile lets you create groups with file syncing, wiki and
discussion - enabling easy collaboration around documents within
a team.
