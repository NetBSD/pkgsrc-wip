Seagull is a free, Open Source (GPL) multi-protocol traffic generator
test tool. Primarily aimed at IMS (3GPP, TISPAN, CableLabs) protocols
(and thus being the perfect complement to SIPp for IMS testing),
Seagull is a powerful traffic generator for functional, load,
endurance, stress and performance/benchmark tests for almost any
kind of protocol.

In addition, its openness allows to add the support of a brand new
protocol in less than 2 hours - with no programming knowledge. For
that, Seagull comes with several protocol families embedded in the
source code:

    Binary/TLV (Diameter, Radius and many 3GPP and IETF protocols)
    External library (TCAP, SCTP)
    Text (XCAP, HTTP, H248 ASCII)
