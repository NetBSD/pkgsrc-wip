- maybe remove send-pr from database/gnats and depend on this instead
  (and get rid of any CONFLICTs)

- send-pr uses LOGNAME to determine the originator of the PR. This is
  geared towards client-server operation, but not suitable for sending
  email. When you override LOGNAME in "$HOME/.send-pr.conf", you break
  (x)emacs locking which appears to get your login from LOGNAME...
