sendmail X is a modularized message transfer system consisting of five
(or more) persistent processes, four of which are multi-threaded. A central
queue manager controls SMTP servers and SMTP clients to receive and send
e-mails, an address resolver provides lookups in various maps including DNS
for mail routing, and a main control program starts the others processes and
watches over their execution. The queue manager organizes the flow of messages
through the system and provides measures to avoid overloading the local or
remote systems by implementing a central control instance.

sendmail X.0 is intended to be used as a secure and efficient mail gateway. It
does not provide any mail content modification capabilities, e.g., address
masquerading.
