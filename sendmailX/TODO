- This package is really raw but it's a start, don't expect it to work
  out of the box

- Status:
NetBSD 2.0   (x86) 	- Builds with and without SSL support
NetBSD 1.6.2 (x86) 	- Builds with and without SSL support
NetBSD 3.0_BETA (x86) 	- Untested

- TODO:
sendmailx, sendailX, smx or smX - choose one and stick to it
finalise smx.conf file to be used
populate aliases more entries perhaps pulling ones from sendmail 8.13.x
build databases e.g. aliases
import usermod changes - it won't work without them
use a few more if's in INSTALL e.g. if [ -d foo ]; then
