sent does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it uses
plaintext files to describe the slides and can include images via farbfeld.
Every paragraph represents a slide in the presentation. Especially for
presentations using the Takahashi method this is very nice and allows you
to write down the presentation for a quick lightning talk within a few minutes.

The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window colored black on white
for maximum contrast even if the sun shines directly onto the projected image.
The content of each slide is automatically scaled to fit the window so you
don't have to worry about alignment. Instead you can really concentrate
on the content.
