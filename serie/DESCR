Serie is a TUI application that uses the terminal emulators image display
protocol to render commit graphs like 'git log --graph --all'.

Why?

While some users prefer to use Git via CLI, they often rely on a GUI or
feature-rich TUI to view commit logs. Others may find 'git log --graph'
sufficient.

Personally, I found the output from 'git log --graph' difficult to read, even
with additional options.
Learning complex tools just to view logs seemed cumbersome.

Goals
 - Provide a rich git log --graph experience in the terminal.
 - Offer commit graph-centric browsing of Git repositories.

Non-Goals
 - Implement a fully-featured Git client.
 - Create a TUI application with a complex UI.
