Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player - it plays audio streamed from
iTunes, iOS, Apple TV and macOS devices and AirPlay sources such as Quicktime
Player and ForkedDaapd, among others.

Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the
source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this way,
synchronised multi-room audio is possible for players that support it.
