shpool is a service that enables session persistence by allowing
the creation of named shell sessions owned by shpool so that the
session is not lost if the connection drops. shpool can be thought
of as a lighter weight alternative to tmux or GNU screen. While
tmux and screen take over the whole terminal and provide window
splitting and tiling features, shpool only provides persistent
sessions. The biggest advantage of this approach is that shpool
does not break native scrollback or copy-paste.
