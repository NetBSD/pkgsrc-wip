Silky is an easy-to-use graphical SILC client. Key features follow:

 * Easy to use. The user experience is similar as in some popular IRC
 * clients.
 * Works in Windows, Linux, OS X, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and possibly in
   some other systems.
 * Uses Gtk+ 2. Doesn't require full Gnome2 to be installed.
 * Uses the SILC Toolkit.
 * Written in C.
 * Supports binary MIME-messages.
 * Open source, GPL licence.
 * Translated already to 7 languages, including Italian, Finnish, German and
   Russian.

The aim of this project is to create a simple and easy to use graphical,
os-independent SILC client. Silky contains, or will eventually contain, all
necessary features of a SILC client. The user interface will be kept as simple
and clean as possible.
