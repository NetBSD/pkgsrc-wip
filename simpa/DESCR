SimpA is based on the A&A (Agents and Artifacts) programming model, which introduces
high-level metaphors taken from human society, namely agents - programmed to
perform some kind of tasks and activities and artifacts as resources and tools
that are dynamically constructed and used by agents to coordinate and execute
their individual and collective activities. A&A gets its main inspiration from
Activity Theory.

Being based on a library on top of Java, simpA applications can be compiled and
run directly on a flat Java environment.
