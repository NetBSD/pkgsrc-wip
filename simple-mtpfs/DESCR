Simple-MTPFS(Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system
for Linux(and other operating system with a FUSE implementation, such as
Mac OS X or FreeBSD) capable of operating on files on MTP devices
attached via USB to local machine. On the local computer where the
SIMPLE-MTPDS is mounted, the implementation makes use of the FUSE
(Filesystem in Userspace) kernel module. The practical effect of this is
that the end user can seamlessly interact with MTP device files.
