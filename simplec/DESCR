This is a port of Small C / 386 to Linux. It is based rather heavily on
a Windows NT port that was pointed out to me on the forum. While I've only
been working on the port for a few weeks, it already compiles simple
applications. I've included several bash scripts to help automate the
process of linking the generated files. You'll need NASM to generate
runnable applications with this.

A lot of work still needs to be done, but you can compile small
applications with it. If you make any improvements, please send them
back to me so I can incorportate them into future releases.
