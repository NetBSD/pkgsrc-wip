simple socket helpers for C++ 2011 (or perhaps C++ 2014).

From C++ the full POSIX and OS socket functions are available.
These are very powerful, offer well known semantics, but are somewhat
of a pain to use.

Various libraries have attempted to offer "C++ native" socket
environments, but most of these offer different semantics that are
less well known. Many of them are also painful to use but in
different ways.

This small set of files attempts to offer:

* A native datastructure that is understood by all socket calls,
  but easily manipulated and created form C++ (ComboAddress)

* Easier to use wrappers of the main BSD socket calls

* A few classes that build on the above to aid you achieve common
  tasks like reading a line from a socket to C++ friendly data
  structures
