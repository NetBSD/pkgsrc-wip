  adc.elf etc. are not installed.
  The reason for that is: in example/python/Makefile,
  all the related lines are commented out probably due to
  USE_AVR_CROSS_TRUE='#' set up. See
     cvs diff -r 1.1  -r 1.2 PLIST |grep \\.elf
  and it will tell the difference.

  (Also, the chunk starting with following line was some
  trial to fix above, but it then failed to create simulavr.pdf)
  ## SUBST_CLASSES+=             python
