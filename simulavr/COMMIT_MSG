(pkgsrc)
  raw simulavr-1.0.0 does not build, some patches, and SUBST to
  convert MACROS etc. are added reflecting git repository
  (These will be unnecessary at next release).

(Upstream)
Bump the version
  simulavr-0.1.2.1 to
  simulavr-1.0.0

(From manual-1.0.pdf)
What features are new:

  - Run multiple AVR devices in one simulation. (only with interpreter
    interfaces or special application linked against simulavr library)
    Multiple cores can run where each has a different clock frequency.

  - Connect multiple AVR core pins to other devices like LCD, LED and
    others. (environment)

  - Connect multiple AVR cores to multiple avr-gdb instances. (each on
    its own socket/port number, but see first point for running multiple
    avr cores)

  - Write simulation scripts in Tcl/Tk or Python, other languages could
    be added by simply adding swig scripts!

  - Tracing the execution of the program, these traces support all
    debugging information directly from the ELF-file.

  - The traces run step by step for each device so you see all actions
    in the multiple devices in time-correct order.

  - Every interrupt call is visible.

  - Interrupt statistics with latency, longest and shortest execution
    time and some more.

  - There is a simple text based UI interface to add LCD, switches, LEDs
    or other components and can modify it during simulation, so there is
    no longer a need to enter a pin value during execution. (Tcl/Tk
    based)

  - Execution timing should be nearly accurate, different access times
    for internal RAM / external RAM / EEPROM and other hardware
    components are simulated.

  - A pseudo core hardware component is introduced to do "printf"
    debugging. This "device" is connected to a normal named UNIX socket
    so you do not have to waste a UART or other hardware in your test
    environment. (How?)

  - ELF-file loading is supported, no objcopy needed anymore.

  - Execution speed is tuned a lot, most hardware simulations are now
    only done if needed.

  - External IO pins which are not ports are also available. (E.g. ADC7
    and ADC8 on ATmega8 in TQFP package.)

  - External I/O and some internal states of hardware units (link
    prescaler counter and interrupt states) can be dumped ot into a VCD
    trace to analyse I/O behaviour and timing. Or you can use it for
    tests.
