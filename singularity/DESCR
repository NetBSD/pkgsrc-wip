Singularity is a container platform focused on supporting "Mobility of Compute"
Mobility of Compute encapsulates the development to compute model where
developers can work in an environment of their choosing and creation and when
the developer needs additional compute resources, this environment can easily
be copied and executed on other platforms. Additionally as the primary use case
for Singularity is targeted towards computational portability, many of the
barriers to entry of other container solutions do not apply to Singularity
making it an ideal solution for users (both computational and
non-computational) and HPC centers.
