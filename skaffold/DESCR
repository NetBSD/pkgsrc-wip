Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for
Kubernetes applications. You can iterate on your application source code
locally then deploy to local or remote Kubernetes clusters. Skaffold handles
the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application. It also
provides building blocks and describe customizations for a CI/CD pipeline.
