Cheap and fast R7RS Scheme Interpreter

SKINT is a portable interpreter for the R7RS Scheme programming
language.  It can be built from five C source files (10K lines of
code) with a single command. There are no distributives or packages;
just compile the source files with your favorite C compiler, link
them with the standard C runtime libraries, and you're done.
