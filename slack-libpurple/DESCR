A Slack protocol plugin for libpurple IM clients.

Here's how slack concepts are mapped to purple:

  * Your "open" channels (on the slack bar) are mapped to the buddy list:
    joining a channel is equivalent to creating a buddy
  * Which conversations are open in purple is up to you, and has no effect
    on slack... (how to deal with activity in open channels with no
    conversation?)
  * For bitlbee IRC connections, Slack channels are "chat channels" that
    can be added to your configuration with
    "`chat add <account id> #<channel>`"
