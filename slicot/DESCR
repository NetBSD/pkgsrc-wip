SLICOT (Subroutine Library In COntrol Theory) is a general purpose basic
mathematical library for control theoretical computations. The library
provides tools to perform essential system analysis and synthesis tasks. The
main emphasis in SLICOT is on numerical reliability of implemented algorithms
and the numerical robustness and efficiency of routines. Providing algorithmic
flexibility and the use of rigorous implementation and documentation standards
are other SLICOT features.

SLICOT is written is Fortran 77 and builds upon the numerical linear algebra
routines from BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) and LAPACK (Linear
Algebra PACKage).

This package is based on Debian's fork, forked before a license change.
