slideml (Slide Meta-Language) is a simple to use meta-language to
generate presentation slides that can be viewed in a web browser.
The idea was to use ASCII-chat like tags that are translated into
XHTML. Joel Sing <joel@sing.id.au> wrote the perl code that translates
the meta-language into XHTML. The JS, XSS & XHTML pieces were
borrowed from Dave Raggett's <dsr@w3.org> HTML Slidy
