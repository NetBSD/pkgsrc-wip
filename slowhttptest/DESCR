SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some Application Layer
Denial of Service attacks. It works on majority of Linux platforms, OSX and
Cygwin - a Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Microsoft
Windows.

It implements most common low-bandwidth Application Layer DoS attacks, such as
slowloris, Slow HTTP POST, Slow Read attack (based on TCP persist timer exploit)
by draining concurrent connections pool, as well as Apache Range Header attack
by causing very significant memory and CPU usage on the server.
