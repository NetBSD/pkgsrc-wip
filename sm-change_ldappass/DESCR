The change_ldappass SquirrelMail plugin allows you to change your account
password which is stored on an LDAP server.  It complements the LDAP address
book and (LDAP) Retreive User Data plugins on systems where IMAP authentication
is done via LDAP.  An extra tweak allows this plugin to update Samba encrypted
password files as well (smbpasswd) for systems that also do Samba
authentication via LDAP.  This keeps the LDAP user account and the samba
password file in sync.
