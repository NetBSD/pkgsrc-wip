The SMS Server Tools 3 is a SMS Gateway software which can send and
receive short messages through GSM modems and mobile phones.

You can send short messages by simply storing text files into a special
spool directory. The program monitors this directory and sends new
files automatically. It also stores received short messages into another
directory as text files.
