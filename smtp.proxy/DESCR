smtp.proxy is an application level gateway for SMTP.
It connects a client to a server running on another machine watching
that the protocol is accomplished.
If commands outside the specification are sent,
they are not forwarded to the server.
Additionaly smtp.proxy offers a small email address control
(only email with a certain sender or recipient address can pass through)
and can optionally remove the `Received:' lines from the mail header.
Instead of forwarding the connection to a remote server,
smtp.proxy can feed it into a local mail server, e.g. sendmail.
