SmtpRC is a program that can be used to scan entire networks for open mail
relays. It is multithreaded so it runs very fast and it is fully
configurable so it can be adjusted to suit any need. With more and more
broadband customers connecting to the internet everyday a great deal of
them are unknowingly running mail servers that are open to abuse from
spammers. SmtpRC was written to enable Systems Administrator to easily
detect those customers and take the appropriate action.
