Super Mario War is a Super Mario multiplayer game.  The goal is to
stomp as many other Marios as possible to win the game.  It's a
tribute to Nintendo and the game Mario War by Samuele Poletto.

The game uses artwork and sounds from Nintendo games. We hope that
this noncommercial fangame qualifies as fair use work. We just
wanted to create this game to show how much we adore Nintendo's
characters and games.
