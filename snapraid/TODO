The provided patch fixes the primary build issue I had with this on 
NetBSD. There are still a couple of warnings shown during the build.
I don't recommend this for production use, until they are classified
/ fixed.

In addition, I am looking for a clean and generic solution to make
application of this patch conditional based on the OPSYS. 

Patches welcome :-)
