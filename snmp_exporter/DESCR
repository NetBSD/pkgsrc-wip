This exporter is the recommended way to expose SNMP data in a format
which Prometheus can ingest.

To simply get started, it's recommended to use the `if_mib` module
with switches, access points, or routers using the `public_v2` auth
module, which should be a read-only access community on the target
device.

Note, community strings in SNMP are not considered secrets, as they
are sent unencrypted in SNMP v1 and v2c. For secure access, SNMP
v3 is required.
