socklog, in cooperation with the runit package, is a small and
secure replacement for syslogd. There are three main features
syslogd provides:

    * receiving syslog messages from an unix domain socket ("/dev/log")
	and writing them to various files on disk depending on
	facility, priority and/or simple pattern matching.
    * receiving syslog messages from an udp socket ("0.0.0.0:514")
	and writing them to various files on disk depending on
	facility, priority and/or simple pattern matching.
    * writing received syslog messages to an udp socket ("a.b.c.d:514")
