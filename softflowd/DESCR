Softflowd is flow-based network traffic analyser capable of Cisco NetFlow(r)
data export. Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows recorded by
listening on a network interface or by reading a packet capture file. These
flows may be reported via NetFlow to a collecting host or summarised within
softflowd itself.
