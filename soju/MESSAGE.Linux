On Linux, if you want to use the built-in identd, you may need to
assign the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability in order for soju to be
able to bind to port 113:

	setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ${PREFIX}/bin/soju

setcap can be found in your distribution's libcap or libcap2-bin
packages, or can be installed from pkgsrc in sysutils/libcap.
