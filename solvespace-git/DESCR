SOLVESPACE is a parametric 3d CAD program. Applications include:

- modeling 3d parts - draw with extrudes, revolves,
  and Boolean (union / difference) operations
- modeling 2d parts - draw the part as a single section,
  and export DXF, PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit
- 3d-printed parts - export the STL or other
  triangle mesh expected by most 3d printers
- preparing CAM data - export 2d vector art for a waterjet
  machine or laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for
  import into third-party CAM software for machining
- mechanism design - use the constraint solver to simulate
  planar or spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints
- plane and solid geometry - replace hand-solved trigonometry
  and spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing
