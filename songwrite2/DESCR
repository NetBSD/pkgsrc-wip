Songwrite 2 is a music score and songbook editor. This software is especially
designed for musicians who do not master solfege (like me!) and to Linuxian
musicians. Songwrite 2 can edit staffs, but also tablatures (for guitar, bass,
banjo, lyre, diatonic accordion,...) and flute fingerings (for tin whistle,
recorder,...); it also manages lyrics. Songwrite 2 can play and print the
partitions.
