Sophia is a modern embeddable key-value database.

It has unique architecture that was created as a result of research and
reconsideration primary algorithmic constraints of Log-file based data
structures, such as LSM-tree. (see architecture)

Sophia is designed for fast write (append-only) and read (range
query-optimized, adaptive architecture) small to medium-sized key-values.

BSD licensed and implemented as small C-written library with zero
dependencies.
