Works only with linux at the moment

##
Note: libudev is not in the pkgsrc-tree in the moment, you must install libudev
your own, or with the package manager of your linux system.

- NetBSD cant configure/build spacefm, while: XClearWindow in -lX11... no
  x11/libX11 dont support XClearWindow
- NetBSD/pkgsrc dont support the required libudev package at the moment.
