SPARK 2014 toolset

SPARK is a software development technology specifically designed for
engineering high-reliability applications.
It consists of a programming language, a verification toolset and a design
method which, taken together, ensure that ultra-low defect software can be
deployed in application domains where high-reliability must be assured
and where safety and security are key requirements.
