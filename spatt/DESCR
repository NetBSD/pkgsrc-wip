SPatt (Statistic for Patterns) is a suite of C++ programs designed for
the computation of pattern occurrences p-value on text. Assuming the text
is generated according to Markov model, the p-value of a given observation
is its probability to occur. The lower is the p-value, the more unlikely is
the observation. For example, this tools can be used to find patterns with
unusual behaviour in DNA sequences
