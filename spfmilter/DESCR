Spfmilter implements the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) as a milter, using
either the libspf or libspf2 libraries.

The idea of SPF is to prevent email forgery. Each participating site sets up
a little definition of which hosts are allowed to send mail claiming to be
from that site. When another site receives mail, it checks the
permitted-senders definition for the originating site. If the check fails,
the mail is rejected.
