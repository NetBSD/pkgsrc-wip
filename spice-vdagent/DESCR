Features:
* Client mouse mode (no need to grab mouse by client, no mouse lag)
  this is handled by the daemon by feeding mouse events into the kernel

* Automatic adjustment of the X-session resolution to the client resolution
* Support of copy and paste (text and images) between the active X-session
  and the client
