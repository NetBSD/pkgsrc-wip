SpiralLoops is an experimental loop based sampler for Linux or BSD.

The idea of SpiralLoops is to provide a simple, visual tool for looping and
layering of sounds; which can be sourced from either wav files on disk, or
from sound generating plugins.

SpiralLoops allows you to create loop based compositions with the minimum
feedback time between the decisions you make and your ears. The looping
mechanism is very flexible, you can lock the timing of loops together, or
offset them for creating complex sequences, such as polyrhythms.
