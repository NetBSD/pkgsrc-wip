Spiral Synth is a physically modelled polyphonic analogue synthesizer for
Linux or BSD.  It is capable of creating the kind of sounds made by
hardware analogue synths, the noises used in electronic music.  You can
also use it to make stranger sounds too.  Midi is supported, including
velocity detection, mapped to the volume of the oscillators (But you can
also use the PC keyboard to play the synth).
