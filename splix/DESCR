SpliX is a set of CUPS printer drivers for SPL (Samsung Printer Language)
printers.

The SPL1 printers use a specific language internally called Smart GDI.
However, SpliX attemps to bring a support for the internally called QPDL
language. Moreover, the smart GDI language is already supported by Ghostscript
under the name "gdi".
For all these reasons, Splix won't support old SPL(1) printers.
