* DESCR

Enhance DESCR to explain how this is different from net/spread.

* Replace/update plan

Explain (perhaps in TOOD; there is no standard place) if this is
replacing net/spread or becoming a new package.

* spread 5 plan

Explain (in TODO?) if wip/spread4 should be updated to 5, or if there
should be a separate wip/spread5.  A straw proposal is that 3 is
needed for old API and python, and that 5 is mostly 4 with IPv6, so
there is no real need to have 4 if 5 is available.

* COMMIT_MSG

Create a COMMIT_MSG that can be used to add a new spread4 package, or
to update net/spread.

* man apges

There is perhaps some @MANTYPE@ confusion.  There are manpages in the
PLIST but they are not build on netbsd-8.

* Hoist license comment from net/spread

((Generally, minimize diffs from net/spread except for intentional
changes.)

* LICENSE

Search licenses/ to see if it really is unique.

Determine if license is DFSG-acceptable

Create a license file, either spread-license or spread and use it.

Document DFSG-ness or lack thereoof in a COMMIT_MSG.license.
