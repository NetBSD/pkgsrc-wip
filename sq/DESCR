sq is a command line tool that provides jq-style access to structured
data sources: SQL databases, or document formats like CSV or Excel. It
is the lovechild of sql+jq.

sq executes jq-like queries, or database-native SQL. It can join across
sources: join a CSV file to a Postgres table, or MySQL with Excel.

sq outputs to a multitude of formats including JSON, Excel, CSV, HTML,
Markdown and XML, and can insert query results directly to a SQL
database.

sq can also inspect sources to view metadata about the source structure
(tables, columns, size). You can use sq diff to compare tables, or
entire databases. sq has commands for common database operations to
copy, truncate, and drop tables.
