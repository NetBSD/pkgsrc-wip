Simple Revision Control

is RCS reloaded with a modern UI, designed to manage single-file solo
projects kept more than one to a directory. Use it for FAQs, ~/bin
directories, config files, and the like. Features integer sequential
revision numbers, a command set that will seem familiar to
Subversion/Git/hg users, and no binary blobs anywhere.
