Until now, Unix developers which required access to a SourceSafe
repository (formerly Visual SourceSafe) had to use a Windows machine
or, in the lucky case that the architecture was standard enough,
pay another time. SSU provides access to local and remote SourceSafe
repositories through TCP, to any POSIX system (Linux, BSDs, OS X,
etc), and for free, alleviating the pain. SSU also improves the
SourceSafe interface and tries to work around several design bugs.

SSU supports and uniforms a good subset of the SourceSafe features
and has proven to be stable when used by a team of 6 developers
accessing a single server. SSU has been developed since one year
now and employs some regression testing. We're interested in
feedback, we'd be glad to know about any success.
