The stmpclean utility removes old files (and old empty directories) from the
specified directory. It'll be typically used to clean directories such as
/tmp where old files tend to accumulate.

The stmpclean utility never removes files or directories owned by root. It is
a feature, not a bug. Great care is taken while descending into the directory,
and the operation is secure. Unlike floating around Perl scripts that do the
same task stmpclean never forks and consumes limited amount of memory (these
Perl script easily turn into forking bombs when someone creates a lot a
directories under /tmp). If your system is attacked and the attacker creates
an extremely deep file hierarchy, stmpclean won't add to the problem by
crashing your system trying to remove it.
