The program structure is a free software package for using multi-locus
genotype data to investigate population structure. Its uses include inferring
the presence of distinct populations, assigning individuals to populations,
studying hybrid zones, identifying migrants and admixed individuals, and
estimating population allele frequencies in situations where many individuals
are migrants or admixed.
