Stumpwm is a tiling, keyboard driven X11 Window Manager written entirely in
Common Lisp. It attempts to be customizable yet visually minimal. There are no
window decorations, no icons, and no buttons. It does have various hooks to
attach your personal customizations, and variables to tweak. With a 100% Common
Lisp window manager there's no stopping the hacks. Just re-eval and GO!
