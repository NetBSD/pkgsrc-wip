'Sudoscript provides an audited shell using sudo(8) and script(1).
The front end script, sudoshell(1) contacts the daemon, sudoscriptd(8).
They agree on the location of a FIFO, which the daemon opens for read.
Sudoshell then runs scropt(1) with the FIFO as a typescript. The daemon
stamps each line of the script(1) outpur with a session id, then passes
the data over to another daemon. This daemon timestamps the data and stores
it in a log file, /var/log/sudscript. This daemon also keeps an eye on
the size of the log, and forks a rotator/compressor when it exceeds 2 MiB.
