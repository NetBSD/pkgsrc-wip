SUNDIALS is a family of software packages providing robust and efficient time
integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated into existing
simulation codes. The packages are designed to require minimal information from
the user, allow users to supply their own data structures underneath the
packages, and enable interfacing with user-supplied or third-party algebraic
solvers and preconditioners.
