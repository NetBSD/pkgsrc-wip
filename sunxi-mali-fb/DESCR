Userspace libraries implementing OpenGL ES for the Mali400 GPUs found in
various Allwinner Technology SoCs (referred to as "sunxi" devices in the
Linux kernel's source code).

The libraries are binary-only and Linux-only.

This package contains the version for using with programs that run in the
framebuffer. The framebuffer has somewhat lower overhead than X11, so
programs run faster.
