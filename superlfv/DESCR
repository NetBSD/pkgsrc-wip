Lepton flavor violation (LFV) is forbidden in the standard model (SM)
given massless neutrinos.  However, this arises from an accidental
symmetry of the SM.  Hence, extensions beyond the SM, generically
predict LFV.

SuperLFV is a numerical tool that accepts an SLHA spectrum file as
input and calculates LFV observables.  The input file may be created
by an existing SLHA spectrum generator, by personal code, or by hand.
The current version of SuperLFV supports the MSSM model, as a low
energy effective theory
