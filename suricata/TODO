#+title: TODO for Suricata 8 package

* Makefile
- pkgconfig overrides for rust/vendor/libz-sys not enabled yet
  - probably needs patches

* configure
- libunwind and dev header not found
- check not found includes, features that exists on NetBSD
  and add support
  
* Compile
- Lots of compile errors :/
