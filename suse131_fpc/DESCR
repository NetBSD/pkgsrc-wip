and is fully compatible with Turbo Pascal 7.0 and nearly Delphi compatible.
Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading and
generics. Shared libraries can be linked. This package contains commandline
compiler and utils. Provided units are the runtime library (RTL), free
component library (FCL) and the base and extra packages.
