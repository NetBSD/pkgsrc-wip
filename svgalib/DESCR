This is a low level console graphics library, originally based on VGAlib 1.2 by
Tommy Frandsen. VGAlib supported  a number  of  standard  VGA graphics modes,
as well high resolution/high color modes on many popular graphics adapters. As
of now, support for  many  more  chipsets  has  been  added.

It supports transparent virtual  console  switching,  that is,  you can switch
consoles to and from text and graphics mode consoles using alt-[function key].
Also, svgalib corrects  most  of  VGAlib's textmode corruption behaviour by
catching SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGILL, and other fatal  signals and  ensuring  that
a program is running in the currently visible virtual console before setting a
graphics mode.
