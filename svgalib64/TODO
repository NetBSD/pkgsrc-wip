I have encountered problems where the console stops displaying.
Sometimes I can switch to another console, and type in stuff
but nothing displays.

So it can be useful to have 2 consoles logged in as root ahead
of time.  When the display gets munged, you can switch to the
other console and blindly type some commands to recover the
console.

Before running a svgalib program, /usr/pkg/bin/savetextmode
You only need to run this once.

Also, do not run the svgalib program on the very first
console.  If the first console gets hosed, it is hosed for
good.

Now, if your svgalib application is not displaying, and you
cannot exit it, try switching to the other console.  You
might still see nothing on the screen, but type
/usr/pkg/bin/textmode

Now you should see what you are typing.  But be warned, do
not switch back to the svgalib application console.  It is
still hosed, and you might get stuck permanently.

Let's say the first console is console 0, and we avoided
the first console and ran the svgalib application on
console 1.

wsconscfg -d -F 1
wsconscfg -t 80x25 -e vt100 1
pkill -f ttyE1

This forcefully deletes console 1, then re-creates it, then
kills the stale getty.  Now you can switch to console 1 and
press enter a few times to get a login prompt.
