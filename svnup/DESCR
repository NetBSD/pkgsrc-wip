net/svnup is a lightweight, dependency-free, BSD licensed program
to pull source files from an Apache Subversion server. In much the
same way that csup and cvsup were used to checkout source code
before the deprecation of CVS at FreeBSD.org, svnup was written
for sysadmins who only need to keep a local source tree in sync
and who don't want or need the extra overhead that the official
svn client leaves behind.
