## [3.0.0] - 2025-2-18

API updates
- Refreshed API cleaning up unused fields, use stdbool type and cleanup redundant parameter in `svt_av1_enc_init_handle`
- Repositioned the presets and removed one preset resulting in a max preset of M10 in the current version
- Added temporal layer and averageQP fields in output picture structure, along with an option to specify a QP offset for the startup gop
- The API changes are not backwards compatible, more details about the changes can be found in issue 2217

Encoder
- Improved mid and high quality presets quality vs speed tradeoffs for fast-decode 2 mode:
-  ~15-25% speedup for M3-M10 at the same quality levels - (!2376 and !2343)
-  ~1% BD-rate improvement for presets M0-M2 - (!2376 and !2343)
- Repositioned the `fast-decode 1` mode to produce ~10% decoder cycle reduction vs `fast-decode 0` while reducing the BD-rate loss to ~1% (!2376)
- Further Arm Neon and SVE2 optimizations that improve high bitdepth encoding by an average of 10-25% for 480p-1080p resolutions beyond the architecture-agnostic algorithmic improvements since v2.3.0
- Ported several features from SVT-AV1-SPY fork to further improve the perceptual quality of `tune 0` mode
- Added an `avif` mode to reduce resource utilization when encoding still images

Cleanup Build and bug fixes and documentation
- third_party: Removed vendored cpuinfo, will attempt to use one provided by the system. For those without cpuinfo, it will be pulled and compiled into the library, similar to before
- Improved the unit test coverage for Arm Neon and SVE2 code
- Updated documentation
