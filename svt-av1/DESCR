The Scalable Video Technology for AV1 (SVT-AV1 Encoder and Decoder) is an
AV1-compliant software encoder/decoder library. The work on the SVT-AV1
encoder targets the development of a production-quality AV1-encoder with
performance levels applicable to a wide range of applications, from premium
VOD to real-time and live encoding/transcoding. The SVT-AV1 decoder
implementation targets future codec research activities.

The SVT-AV1 project was initially founded by Intel in partnership with
Netflix, and was then adopted by the Alliance of Open Media (AOM)
Software Implementation Working Group (SIWG), in August 2020, to
carry on the group's mission.
