Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement
for the i3 window manager for X11. It works with your existing
i3 configuration and supports most of i3's features, plus
a few extras.
Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically,
rather than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by
default which maximizes the efficiency of your screen and can
be quickly manipulated using only the keyboard.
