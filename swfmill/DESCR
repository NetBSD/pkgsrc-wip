swfmill is a tool to process Shockwave Flash(TM) (SWF) files.
It can convert SWF from and to an XML-dialect called "swfml",
which is closely modeled after the SWF file format.

It also provides a libxslt-based XSL transformator that
supports an extension ("swft") which helps with generating
IDs for SWF objects and can import an SWF as XML using an
XPath command (swft:document()).
