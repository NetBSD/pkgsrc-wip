Swift is trying to plug a hole in the XMPP client landscape, and has
these aims:

    * Wide platform availability.
    * Doing the "Right Thing" for the user, without configuration.
    * Doing the "Right Thing" with standards-compliance.
    * Targeting the end-users, not the system administrators.
    * Being an XMPP client - not multi-protocol.
    * Concentrating on the most frequently performed tasks.
    * Never interrupt the user with something that doesn't need attention.

Features of interest

    * Easy status setting.
    * Easy room joining and bookmarking.
    * XEP-0258 Labelling for secure environments.
    * Stream compression for bandwidth-saving.
    * Support for the new SCRAM authentication mechanism.
