SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)

SWIG is a compiler that integrates C and C++ with languages including
Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, D, Go, Lua, Octave, R,
Scheme (Guile, MzScheme/Racket, CHICKEN), Scilab, Ocaml, Modula-3,
Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI) and Pike. SWIG can also
export its parse tree into XML and Lisp s-expressions.

SWIG reads annotated C/C++ header files and creates wrapper code
(glue code) in order to make the corresponding C/C++ libraries
available to the listed languages, or to extend C/C++ programs with
a scripting language.

This is version 4 of swig.
