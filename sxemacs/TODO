(1) Prefix all xemacs derived tools, files, man pages etc to avoid
    conflicts with xemacs-21.* packages

(2) Should we use the xemacs-packages, or create a new sxemacs-packages?
    If the former, how to change the dependencies of xemacs-packages
    accordingly?

(3) Fix PLIST issues

(4) Per default, sxemacs appears not to install gnuclient*, 
    but installs the man pages?

(5) Feed back the patches to SXEmacs maintainers

(6) Fix the ugly X11 toolkit selection

(7) Is this OSS sound support still relevant?
