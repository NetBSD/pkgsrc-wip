sxid tracks any changes in s[ug]id files and folders. If there are any
new ones, ones that aren't set any more, or they have changed bits or
other modes then it reports the changes. It also tracks s[ug]id files by
md5 checksums. This helps detect if a root kit has been installed which
would not show under normal name and permissions checking.
