Sylvan is a parallel (multi-core) multi-terminal binary decision diagram
library written in C. Sylvan implements typical binary decision diagram
operations also found in libraries like CUDD, but provides scalable parallel
execution of these operations and is more versatile thanks to supporting custom
decision diagram terminal types.
