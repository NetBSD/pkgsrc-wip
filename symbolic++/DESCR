SymbolicC++ uses C++ and object-oriented programming to develop a computer
algebra system. Object-oriented programming is an approach to software design
that is based on classes rather than procedures. This approach maximizes
modularity and information hiding. Object-oriented design provides many
advantages. For example, it combines both the data and the functions that
operate on that data into a single unit. Such a unit
(abstract data type) is called a class.
