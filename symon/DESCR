symon is a system monitor. It can be used to obtain accurate and up to
date information on the performance of a number of systems.

Currently the "suite" consists of these parts:

symon - lightweight system monitor. Can be run with privileges
equivalent to nobody on the monitored host. Offers no functionality
but monitoring and forwarding of measured data.

symux - persists data. Incoming symon streams are stored on disk in
rrd files. symux offers systems statistics as they come in to 3rd
party clients.

syweb - draws rrdtool pictures of the stored data. syweb is a php
script that can deal with chrooted apaches. It can show all systems
that are monitored in one go, or be configured to only show a set of
graphs.

sylcd - symux client that drives CrystalFontz and HD44780 lcds. sylcd
shows current network load on a specific host.

SymuxClient.pm - generic perl symux client. Could, for instance, be
used to get the hourly amount of data that was transmitted on a
particular interface.
