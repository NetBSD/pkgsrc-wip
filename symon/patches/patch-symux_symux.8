 Also note that symon(8) measures io1 or io2 depending on whether it was
 compiled on a host that supports version 1 or 2. The rrd datastructures of
 these streams differ and there is no easy way to change an io1 rrd into an io2

 symon versions 2.78 and up will always report if2 and mem2 statistics. The rrd
 files for the old and new probes are identical and need not be changed.
