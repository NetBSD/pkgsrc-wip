Orange is part of the SynCE project.

Orange is a tool and library for squeezing out juicy installable
Microsoft Cabinet Files from self-extracting installers for Microsoft
Windows and some other installer file formats. It currently supports the
following kinds of installers:

    * Self-extracting installers (EXE):
          o Early support for installers created by Installer VISE.
          o Support for some installers created by Inno Setup.
          o Setup Factory versions 5 and 6 using Dynamite for data
	    decompression.
          o Some other installer (using a DLL called inflate.dll). This
	    is used by for example Macromedia Flash Player 6 for Pocket PC
	    2002.
          o InstallShield self-extracting installers.
