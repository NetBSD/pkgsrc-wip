error: failed to select a version for `openssl-sys`.

versions that meet the requirements `^0.9.104` are: 0.9.104

the package `openssl-sys` links to the native library `openssl`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `openssl` as well:
package `openssl-sys v0.9.102`
    ... which satisfies dependency `openssl-sys = "^0.9.64"` (locked to 0.9.102) of package `curl v0.4.46`
    ... which satisfies dependency `curl = "^0.4.25"` (locked to 0.4.46) of package `sentry v0.34.0 (/scratch/wip/syncstorage-rs/work/sentry-rust-1b65b5c99af975496880e7325218479e0037d097/sentry)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `sentry` of package `syncserver v0.17.13 (/scratch/wip/syncstorage-rs/work/syncstorage-rs-0.17.13/syncserver)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "openssl"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
