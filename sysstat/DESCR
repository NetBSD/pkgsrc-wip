The sysstat utilities are a collection of performance monitoring
tools for Linux. These include mpstat, iostat, sar, sadc, sadf and
sa tools. They are front-ends to the kernel proc filesystem.

The mpstat tool reports statistics for each processor. iostat
reports CPU stats and input/output statistics for devices and
partitions. sar is used to collect, report, or save system activity
information.
