The System Tools Backends (s-t-b for short) are a set of cross-platform
modules for Linux, FreeBSD and other Unix systems. The backends provide a
common DBus interface to all platforms to modify or read the system
configuration in a distro independent fashion. Historically, access to
system configuration has varied deeply across Unix flavours, and concreting
a bit more, across Linux distributions, making it near impossible to write
desktop tools that could work flawlessly in a cross-platform way. System
Tools Backends try to fill this gap, offering a generic and easy way for
desktop applications to read and modify configuration details.
