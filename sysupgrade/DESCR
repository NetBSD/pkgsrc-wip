sysupgrade is a script to automate NetBSD system upgrades.  sysupgrade
works by first fetching distribution sets from a specified site or local
directory, then by upgrading the system using such distribution sets and
later by ensuring that the system configuration is up to date.  All the
process is controlled by a configuration file, and the defaults should
suit the most common NetBSD upgrades.

sysupgrade can be used to perform upgrades across different system major
and/or minor versions, and it can also be used to track a stable or
development branch from the CVS repository.

sysbuild is the perfect companion to sysupgrade in those cases where you
want to roll your own binaries: both utilities share a very similar
command-line and configuration interface, and the default configuration
files provide examples on how to integrate one with the other.
