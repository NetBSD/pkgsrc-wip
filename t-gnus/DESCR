Gnus is a flexible message reader running under GNU Emacs. It supports
reading and composing both news and mail. In addition, it is able to
use a number of web-based sources as inputs for its groups.

The main Gnus goal is to provide the user with an efficient and
extensible interface towards dealing with large numbers of messages,
no matter the form they may have or wherever they may come from.

Major Gnus milestones are named like hurricanes, only backwards, with an 
odd pronounceable word the first letter of which advances toward the 
beginning of the alphabet.

T-Gnus (gnu with T-Shirt) is a fork of Oort Gnus that uses SEMI for its MIME 
support rather than the MIME stuff built into regular Gnus.  It's most 
important feechur is the printing of an annoyingly long User-agent: 
header so that everyone can tell you are running an obscure Gnus variant.
