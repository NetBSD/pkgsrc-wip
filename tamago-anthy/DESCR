  The Tamago(egg) is famous CJK input system for Emacs.  It
works with KANA-Kanji converson engine as FreeWnn, Canna, Sj3.
We have another version of kana-Kanji conversion engine:
Anthy.  Anthy has its anthy.el for bridge, but this is yet
another Tamago(egg) like input bridge to connect Emacs and
Anthy engine, and this can be replacement of Original Tamago.
