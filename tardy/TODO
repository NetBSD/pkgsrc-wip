* test/00/t0012a.sh
  fails

  This is due to BSD cpio not recognizing the output file from tardy. I assume
  archivers/gcpio would recognize it. gcpio conflicts with gtar-base and I have not gotten
  around to testing in e.g. a chroot with gcpio.

* add option 'testing' to mk/defaults/options.description
  Does not seem to be quite the right way to handle this.
  Better would be per-phase DEPENDS variables, like there already are in BUILD_DEPENDS and
  DEPENDS.
