cross/tavrasm: Import Toms AVR assembler 1.22

Version 1.22 - January 2005

- Several updates for ATmega (new devices, extended I/O etc.)
  Thanks to Dariusz Kowalewski for these updates.

- Fixed problem with .db 00
  Thanks Mike Hall for reporting this.

- Fixed 'symtab = (new (symbolTableEntry*))[size]' blunder.
  How that ever slipped by GCC is beyond me :-)
  Lots of compilers won't even allow it.
  Thanks to Steven Saunderson for reporting this.
