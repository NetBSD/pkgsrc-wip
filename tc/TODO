1. With emacs29,
   it seems that either with NetBSD/amd64 9.4 or with 10.99.14 this is packaged fine

2. It can start Japanese input, but when switching back to
   alphabetical input, it stops with error

   | deactivate-input-method: Symbol's function definition is void: nil

3. To avoid this, put following lines in ~/.emacs
   -------------------------
   ;;; https://www.mail-archive.com/users-jp@freebsd.org/msg00229.html
   ;; for uim-leim.el
   (define-obsolete-variable-alias 'inactivate-current-input-method-function
     'deactivate-current-input-method-function "24.3")
   (define-obsolete-function-alias 'inactivate-input-method
     'deactivate-input-method "24.3")
   -------------------------

- Upstream code includes only upto emacs 24 (?)
  .. it is kind of beyond packaging 
  .. and may ignore for the moment.
  
- Which tc-is??.el is byte-compiled depends on emacs version
  (incremental search needs by-version caring).
  So fix PLIST variation on emacsen 20/21/22/23/24
  .. meaning that working emacs version detection is necessary.
