Tiny C Compiler - C Scripting Everywhere - The Smallest ANSI C compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:
--------
- SMALL! You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for example on
  rescue disks.
- FAST! tcc generates optimized x86 code. No byte code
  overhead. Compile, assemble and link about 7 times faster than 'gcc
  -O0'.
- UNLIMITED! Any C dynamic library can be used directly. TCC is
  heading torward full ISOC99 compliance. TCC can of course compile
  itself.
- SAFE! tcc includes an optional memory and bound checker. Bound
  checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.
- Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly
  necessary. Full C preprocessor included.
- C script supported : just add '#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run' at the first
  line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command
  line.
