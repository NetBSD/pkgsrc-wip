* Original pkg seems to work under Linux and FreeBSD
  I patch a little bit FreeBSD #ifs and compiles under
  NetBSD, but doesn't works fine.
* Could be a freebsd bug also, I doesn't test it :/
* This package has known vulnerabilities, please investigate and fix if possible:
    CVE-2018-20374, CVE-2018-20375, CVE-2018-20376, CVE-2019-9754, CVE-2019-12495
