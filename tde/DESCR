TDE is a simple, public domain, multi-file/multi-window binary and text
file editor written for IBM PCs and close compatibles running DOS, Win32
(console) or Linux. TDE is suitable for editing batch files, binary
files, text files, and various computer language source code files (with
configurable syntax highlighting). The only limit on the number and size
of files that TDE can handle is the amount of memory. Likewise, the only
limit on the number of windows is the amount of memory. There is no
preset maximum number of files or windows that may be open at any one
time.
