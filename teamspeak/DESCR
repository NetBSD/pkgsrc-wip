Teamspeak is a quality, scalable application which enables people to
speak with one another over the Internet. Teamspeak consists of both
client and server software. The Teamspeak server acts as a host to
multiple client connections, capable of handling literally thousands of
simultaneous users. This results in an Internet based teleconferencing
solution that works in a variety of applications such as team mates
speaking with one another while playing their favorite online game,
small businesses cutting costs on long distance charges, or for personal
communication with friends and family.
