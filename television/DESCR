Television is a cross-platform, fast and extensible fuzzy finder for the
terminal.

It integrates with your shell and lets you quickly search through any kind of
data source (files, git repositories, environment variables, docker images, you
name it) using a fuzzy matching algorithm and is designed to be extensible.

It is inspired by the neovim telescope plugin and leverages tokio and the
nucleo matcher used by the helix editor to ensure optimal performance.
