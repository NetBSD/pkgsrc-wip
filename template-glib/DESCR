Template-GLib is a library to help you generate text based on a template and
user defined state. Template-GLib does not use a language runtime, so it is
safe to use from any GObject-Introspectable language.

Template-GLib allows you to access properties on GObjects as well as call
simple methods via GObject-Introspection. See our examples for how to call
methods.
