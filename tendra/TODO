Fix PLIST.
Some comments from Alistair:
At the moment, it can't handle the RENAME()s in NetBSD's header files,
and I build things in a ${WRKSRC}/build directory, and these files need
to be moved to ${PREFIX} in the install stage. The files should also be
checked to see if there are any embedded hardcoded paths, which would
make this approach infeasible.

Build fails on 1.6.1:
