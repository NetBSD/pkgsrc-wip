Teng strictly separates application logic from presentation logic. Programmer
writes code which fetches data (for example from database, application server
etc.) and supplies them to the templating engine. Presentation coder (for
example web designer) writes templates and doesn't bother about data origin.
The only thing programmer and presentation coder must obey is that data
structure must conform to the template.

Probably the most important use of Teng is generating HTML pages for web
presentations. It is also wery useful for generating mail messages
(but not spams).

Teng composes resulting text/page/file by combining input template with program
supplied data together with (optional) configuration and localization
(language) dictionary.
