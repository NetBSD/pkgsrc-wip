The Free Tengwar Font Project aims at developing a family of general purpose
fonts that cover J. R. R. Tolkien's Tengwar script and that are compatible with
the Unicode standard. Additional aims are tools and documentation for the use of
such fonts. Compatibility with Unicode means that these fonts' Tengwar glyphs
will not be mapped over any other Unicode character. Instead, they are mapped on
the Personal Use Area of Unicode.
