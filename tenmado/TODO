We just use /var/games right now.  I don't think this is going to change
in the future.  However, I spoke briefly with Thomas about this, and I
believe that shortly we'll have a 'games' package that will handle the
'games' user and group as well as ensuring that /var/games exists and is
sane.

Stay tuned.
