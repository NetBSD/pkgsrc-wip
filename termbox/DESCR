Termbox is a library that provides minimalistic API which allows the
programmer to write text-based user interfaces.
It is based on a very simple abstraction. The main idea is viewing
terminals as a table of fixed-size cells and input being a stream of
structured messages.
The model is inspired by the windows console API.
The abstraction itself is not perfect and it may create problems in
certain areas. The most sensitive ones are copy & pasting and wide
characters (mostly Chinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK) characters).
When it comes to copy & pasting, the notion of cells is not really
compatible with the idea of text. And CJK runes often require more
than one cell to display them nicely.
Termbox is aimed at pseudo-graphical user interfaces.
