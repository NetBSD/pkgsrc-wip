This package provides an intuitive functional programming
interface for LaTeX2, which is an alternative choice to expl3
or LuaTeX, if you want to do programming in LaTeX. Although
there are functions in LaTeX3 programming layer (expl3), the
evaluation of them is from outside to inside. With this
package, the evaluation of functions is from inside to outside,
which is the same as other programming languages such as Lua.
In this way, it is rather easy to debug code too.
