This package enables the visualization of seating charts,
whereby the seating layouts (i.e. the arrangement of seats in a
room) and the seating scheme (i.e. the selection and labeling
of occupied seats) can be controlled independently of each
other. The package should be considered experimental and
requires LuaLaTeX.
