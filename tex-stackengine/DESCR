   The stackengine package provides a versatile way to vertically stack
objects in a variety of customizable ways.  A number of useful macros
are provided, all of which make use of the stackengine core.  These
macros allow a wide variety of tasks, including:

-creating aligned stacks of specified inter-item gap;
-creating aligned stacks of specified inter-item baselinse shift;
-stacking both above and below the baseline;
-overlaying character glyphs;
-insetting graphical images atop larger background images;
-top and bottom lapping;
-shifting the horizontal axis of a stack;
-changing the baseline of an object;
-subfigure stacking and labeling;

   This package can be set to process its arguments in either text mode or
in math mode.
