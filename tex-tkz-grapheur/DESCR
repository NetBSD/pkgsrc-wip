This package provides some commands to help French mathematics
teachers for 15-18 years olds, with graphs of functions: define
and draw functions and interpolations curves work with
integrals, tangents, intersersections get coordinates of points
... The syntax is rather explicit, like \DefinirCourbe,
\RecupererCoordonnees,\TrouverIntersections, etc.
