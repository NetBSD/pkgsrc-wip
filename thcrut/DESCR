RUT (aRe yoU There, pronouced as 'root') is your first knife on foreign
network. It gathers informations from local and remote networks.
It offers a wide range of network discovery tools: arp lookup on
an IP range, spoofed DHCP request, RARP, BOOTP, ICMP-ping, ICMP
address mask request, OS fingerprintings, high-speed host discovery, ...
THC-RUT now comes with a new OS Fingerprint implementation. It gathers
tcp stack informations, banners, open/closed port characteristics and
timing values and tosses them through a perl regular expression matrix to
determine the OS with high accuracy. The tool is capable of discovering
a Class B network within 10 minutes. Banner information are taken from
(amoung others) SNMP replies, telnetd (NVT) negotiation options,
generic Banner Matching, HTTP-Server version, DCE request and tcp options.
