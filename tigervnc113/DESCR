TigerVNC is a high-performance, platform-neutral implementation of
VNC (Virtual Network Computing), a client/server application that
allows users to launch and interact with graphical applications on
remote machines. TigerVNC provides the levels of performance
necessary to run 3D and video applications, and it attempts to
maintain a common look and feel and re-use components, where
possible, across the various platforms that it supports. TigerVNC
also provides extensions for advanced authentication methods and
TLS encryption.
