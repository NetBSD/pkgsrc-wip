timescaledb-tune is a program for tuning a TimescaleDB database to perform its
best based on the host's resources such as memory and number of CPUs. It parses
the existing postgresql.conf file to ensure that the TimescaleDB extension is
appropriately installed and provides recommendations for memory, parallelism,
WAL, and other settings.
