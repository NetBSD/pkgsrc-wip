Tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but which
should also work with other window managers.

lightweight and in compliance with freedesktop specifications.

    * color/transparency on font, icon, border and background
    * customize mouse event
    * drag and drop task between desktop and switch desktop
