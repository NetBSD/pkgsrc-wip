[incr Tk] is a framework for building mega-widgets using the [incr Tcl] object
system. Mega-widgets are high-level widgets like a file browser or a tab
notebook that act like ordinary Tk widgets but are constructed using Tk widgets
as component parts, without having to write C code. In effect, a mega-widget
looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget, but is considerably easier to
implement.

This package provides itk version 3.x.
