The Tile Widget Set is a next-generation re-implementation of many of the core
Tk widgets, along with the addition of several new widgets. With Tile,
Tk applications can achieve an appearance much closer to native platform
widgets, as well as take advantage of a modern, highly dynamic theme engine
to produce a wide variety of alternative user interface styles. Tile widgets
complement the existing Tk widgets, and Tile is currently being incorporated
directly into Tk.
