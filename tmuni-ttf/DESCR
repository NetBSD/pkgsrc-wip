The Tibetan & Himalayan Library makes available the alpha release of
the Unicode character based Tibetan Machine Uni OpenType font for
writing Tibetan, Dzongkha and Ladakhi in dbu can script with full
support for the Sanskrit combinations found in chos skad texts.

This font is based on the Tibetan Machine font originally designed and
developed by Tony Duff of the Tibetan Computer Company over many
years, the rights of which were purchased from him by the Trace
Foundation in order to make it freely available under the terms of the
Gnu General Public License.

OpenType tables and more than 2,000 additional glyphs were added to
the original font by Nathaniel Garson and Christopher Fynn under the
auspices of THL. This new OpenType version of the font contains almost
4,000 glyphs and can generate over 20,000 different combinations.

The Tibetan Machine Uni font was developed to enable Unicode based
Tibetan script computing on Microsoft Windows, Java, Unix and Linux
platforms - or any platform with an OpenType shaping engine supporting
Tibetan script.
