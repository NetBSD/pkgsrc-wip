tolua++ is an extension of toLua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code with Lua.
tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++, such as class templates.

tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code with
Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua automatically generates the
binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua-5.0 API and
metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++
constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods to
Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.
