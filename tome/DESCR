Tales of Middle Earth (ToME) is a fantasy adventure game, based on the
works of J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a game that emphasizes intricate,
challenging, and varied gameplay over graphics. Hundreds of different
monsters in randomly-generated, unpredictable dungeons will strive to
slay you by various means, and you counter - if you survive - by
developing the skills of your choice and wielding mighty
artifacts. ToME's races from Hobbit to Troll and classes from
Swordmaster to Summoner allow for many different playing styles and a
replay value that extends through years.
