editors/tp-note: add version 1.24.4

v1.24.4
Downgrade some dependencies to comply with rustc 1.77.2, no code changes

v1.24.3
Enhance the HTML clipboard configuration options

This release extends the `html_to_markup` filter by adding a `default=`
parameter in case the filter fails, its result is the empty string, or if
the filter is disabled for a certain markup language with the configuration
variable `extensions.1`.

The `clipboard` variable is replaced by the variables `txt_clipboard` and
`html_clipbaord`. They both represent the clipboard's text content. The
difference is, that the `html_clipboard` carries HTML formatting along the
text, while `txt_clipboard` holds the plain text only.
