Provides screenshots upload and viewing subsystem for Trac.

Uploaded screenshots can be described with short name, longer
description and custom tags (if TracTags plugin is installed) and
assigned to any number of components and versions registered in Trac.
Screenshot uploads can be listed in timeline and screenshots can be
referenced or embedded in wiki pages. Plugin internally defines few
interfaces for further extension.

The name is a little misleading as of course it is perfectly able to be
used as a picture archive for the wiki pages.
