Treetool is an interactive tool for displaying, editing, and printing
phylogenetic trees.  The tree is displayed visually on screen, in
various formats, and the user is able to modify the format, structure,
and characteristics of the tree.  Trees may be viewed, compared,
formatted for printing, constructed from smaller trees, etc...

Treetool works with Newick format tree files (Paup and Phylip
compatible).  It handles multifurcating trees, branch lengths
(evolutionary distances), rooted/unrooted trees, and multiple trees
per file.  It can print to a PostScript printer, or output PICT
graphics for Macintosh drawing programs (MacDraw).

Treetool 2.0.1 is available in binary form for Sun Sparc machines (Sun
4's) and in source form. Treetool requires X-windows (from MIT), and
the Xview toolkit (from Sun Microsystems).  Both are free
(copyrighted) software, available readily from a number of sources
(both are available by anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu).
