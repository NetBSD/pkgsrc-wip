Trifecta is a computer program that delivers you a website/web
service. Your personal imgur. You can paste or drag images to
Trifecta. If you upload an image, a post will be created for it
automatically.

A post can contain multiple images. Each image can have a caption,
and each post a title.

Posts can be public or not, or have a time limit on their public
visibility. As owner of a post you can extend or change this limit.

Users can sign in using an temporary email link, and also reset
their password this way. Users need not have an actual password.

Posts in Trifecta get opengraph tags so you get nice previews on
social media and in messengers.
