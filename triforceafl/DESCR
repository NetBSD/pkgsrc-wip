Patched version of AFL that supports full-system fuzzing
using QEMU. The included QEMU has been updated to allow tracing
of branches when running a system emulator for x86_64.
Extra instructions have been added to start AFL's forkserver,
make fuzz settings, and mark the start and stop of test cases.
