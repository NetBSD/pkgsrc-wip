A 3D rally simulation with a great physics engine for drifting, over 200 maps, 
different terrain materials like dirt, asphalt, sand, ice etc. and various 
weather, light and fog conditions give this rally simulation the edge over many
other free games. You need to make it through the maps in often tight time
limits and can further improve by beating the recorded high scores. All attached
single races must be finished in time in order to win an event, unlocking
additional events and cars. Most maps are equipped with spoken co-driver notes
and co-driver icons.

Many configuration details for display and audio adjustments can be edited in
the well documented plain text configuration file.

Additional contributed maps and events are ready for download as plugins.

Trigger Rally works well with common low performance laptops from about 2008. 
And if something like snow flakes and vegetation sprites demand to much from
your system you can just disable it.
