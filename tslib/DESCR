tslib is a cross-platform library that provides access to touchscreen
devices and the ability to apply filters to their input events.

tslib is used to access touch screen devices, in case the operating
system doesn't provide driver support. It may instead also only be used
to optimize the touch user experience by applying mathematical filters
in any number or order. The libts library is highly configurable
and portable. tslib includes tools to calibrate, test and use the
library. It is well suited for embedded devices and used in many
commercial products. tslib includes documentation on how to use it.
