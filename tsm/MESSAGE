$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.8 2010/01/15 14:55:36 hfath Exp $

Tivoli Storage Manager Client has been installed in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli
with binaries in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin
and configuration in
		${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}

NetBSD configuration hints:

- TSM expects ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab to exist and be meaningful. The
  suse_base package sets up a symlink to ${EMULDIR}/proc/mounts
  (make sure it links to /proc/mounts instead for NetBSD 5 and newer!),
  which works on NetBSD 3 or newer if you mount procfs like
  >> procfs  /emul/linux/proc  procfs  ro,linux  0 0 <<
  in /etc/fstab.
  Alternatively, make ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab a symlink to /etc/fstab.

- Make sure 'passworddir' is set in tsm.sys so that the passwd file
  ends up in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} instead of the shadow hierarchy.

- The environment variables DSM_DIR, DSM_CONFIG, DSM_LOG
  need to be set properly. DSM_LOG may inadvertently end up in the emul
  shadow hierarchy, unless you make ${EMULDIR}/var/log a symbolic
  link to /../var/log/.
  There is a sample start script in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/tsm.

- For backing up the native filesystem hierarchy, use a construct
  like "ln -s / /.`hostname`" to break out of the emul shadow hierarchy.

TSM documentation (html and pdf) is installed under
	${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/books.
