Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/turba/INSTALL

on how to setup your Turba installation. You need to at least edit

	${PREFIX}/share/horde/config/registry.php

to enable Turba in the horde framework.  You will also need to configure Turba 
by using the Horde administrative interface.

Finally you will also need to make Turba accessible through your HTTP server.  
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf
	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/turba.conf
