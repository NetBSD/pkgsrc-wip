TuxTyping is an educational typing tutorial game for children
starring Tux, the Linux Penguin. It features several different
types of gameplay, at a variety of difficulty levels.

In Fish Cascade, you control Tux as he searches for fish to eat.
Fish fall from the top of the screen. These fish have letters on
them.  Unforunate for Tux, eating a fish with a letter on it will
cause his stomach to become ill, so it is up to you to help Tux
eat fish!  By typing the letters, it will cause them to disappear
so tux can chow down on the fish.

In Comet Zap, you control tux as he defends the city from comets.
To protect a city from a comet, type the letter on the comet and
it will cause tux to destroy it with a laser.

This is TuxType2 which is very different from old TuxType.
