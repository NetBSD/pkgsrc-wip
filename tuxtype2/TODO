this is called tuxtype2 (with "2") because developer, Sam Hart, said:
"name it tuxtype2. tuxtype == tuxtype 1, and is very 
different from tuxtype2."

this doesn't run under NetBSD/i386 1.6. I sent a note to tuxtype developers.
CFLAGS+=        -DDEBUG

runs fine on NetBSD 1.6ZK i386

maybe put html docs under a HTML directory
