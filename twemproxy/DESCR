twemproxy (pronounced "two-em-proxy"), aka nutcracker is a fast and lightweight
proxy for memcached and redis protocol. It was built primarily to reduce the
number of connections to the caching servers on the backend. This, together
with protocol pipelining and sharding enables you to horizontally scale your
distributed caching architecture.
