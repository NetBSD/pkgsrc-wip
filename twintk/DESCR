Twintk, the Terminal Windows Toolkit, is a library for developing intuitive
terminal-based applications utilizing menus, color, dialogs, etc.

It utilizes 3 separate layers:

Image: A buffer containing the current window or terminal content

Terminal: A structure representing a terminal screen, including its image

Window: A structire representing a window, including its image

A window or terminal can be updated immediately via functions like wputc() or
a curses-like strategy can be used by updating the image only and then
redrawing the window or terminal. The developer can choose which approach is
best for each situation.
