- this u-boot build might place the DTB in the BSS section:
  https://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2025/12/14/msg009487.html

  If we can't resolve this upstream, we might have to change the
  boot command in the config to something like this:

  env set fdt_high 0x41000000;
  fatload mmc 0:2 0x41000000 imx23-olinuxino.dtb;
  fatload mmc 0:2 0x42000000 uImage;
  bootm 0x42000000 - 0x41000000;
