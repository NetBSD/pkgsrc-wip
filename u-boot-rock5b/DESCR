U-Boot is a bootloader for embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and
several other processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application code.

This package provides Collabora's U-Boot for the rk3588-based Rock 5B from
Radxa.
