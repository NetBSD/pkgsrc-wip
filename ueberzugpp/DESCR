Ueberzug++ is a command line utility written in C++ which allows
to draw images on terminals by using X11/wayland child windows,
sixels, kitty and iterm2..

This project intends to be a drop-in replacement for the now defunct
ueberzug project.

Advantages over w3mimgdisplay and ueberzug:

- support for wayland: sway, hyprland and wayfire
- support for MacOS
- no race conditions as a new window is created to display images
- expose events will be processed, so images will be redrawn on
  switch workspaces
- tmux support on X11, sway and hyprland
- terminals without the WINDOWID environment variable are supported
- chars are used as position - and size unit
- No memory leak (usage of smart pointers)
- A lot of image formats supported (through opencv and libvips).
