textproc/ugrep: Update to v5.1.1

- a minor improvement of the regex syntax to allow escaped spaces
- updated POSIX regex lazy quantifier matching in linear time using an
  advanced DFA transformation algorithm
- minor update to fix a problem with POSIX lazy quantifier matching when
  combined with anchors, causing longer pattern matches than expected
