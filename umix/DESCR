Umix is a program for adjusting soundcard volumes and other features
in soundcard mixers. You can control your volumes, balances and recording
sources flexibly from the command line or using a ncurses user interface
with vi/emacs-alike keybindings. Umix supports multiple mixer devices that
are dynamically loaded at runtime as plugins. All settings can be saved and
loaded from a file.
