Unagi is a modular compositing manager which aims to be efficient, lightweight
and responsive. It is currently written in C programming language and based on
XCB library client library. Any existing window manager can be used as long as
it implements properly EWMH and ICCCM specifications (or at least parts of it
which are needed), which is generally the case nowadays.

This project also aims to provide a functional and stable software to improve
window manager usability from an end-user point of view (for instance windows
translucency, application-switcher using live thumbnails instead of plain icons,
Expose...), therefore it does not intend at all to provide useless eye-candy
effects.
