Quest for the Unicorn is a rogue-like game built with a graphical
interface instead of pure text. The inspriation for its creation
came from games like Rogue, Hack, and Moria.  For those more hardcore
rogueists out there I have created the HC (hard core) version of
Quest for the Unicorn. In this version the interface has been
replaced by a pure text interface instead of the graphic tileset
and permadeath has been implemented.
