* There are libtool errors in the install stage:
	libtool: warning: 'path/to/file.la' has not been installed in 'path/to/install'
* This package has been only tested in FreeBSD 11.
* This package depends on some pre-installed patched dependencies that were previously
  imported to pkgsrc-wip as: unimrcp-{apr|aprutil|sofiasip}. Thus, these dependencies
  as well as this package, may need further review and optimization.
