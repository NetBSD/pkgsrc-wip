net/unison: Update to 2.53.6

## Changes in 2.53.6 (NOT YET RELEASED) 

Released FUTURE

  * Remove workaround for Windows DST: Time differences of one hour
    are no longer treated as not different.
  * Time remaining, when over 24h, shown as days and HMS instead of
    just HMS.
  * Stop using deprecated [GdkPixbuf.from_xpm_data] (avoids problems
    with some versions of gdkpixbuf).

  Deprecation warning: support for external rsync will be removed,
  likely in 2.54.0.
