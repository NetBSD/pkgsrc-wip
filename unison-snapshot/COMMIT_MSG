Upstream NEWS

## Changes in 2.53.8

Released 2025-11-05

  * Improve and simplify makefiles.
    It is now possible to build with BSD make, Solaris/illumos make and
        NMAKE, in addition to GNU Make.  Building with MSVC is much simpler
        now.  The changes are larger than might be expected in a micro;
    anyone building from source (or packaging) should consult
    INSTALL.md for updated build instructions.
  * Stop installing fsmonitor.py.
  * Add ability to use reflinking instead of copying (if supported by
    filesystem).
  * Don't write fpcache if it is not necessary.
  * Experimental default-off support to detect moves/renames and
        rename on destination instead of copying (see -moves-experimental).

  Deprecation warning: support for external rsync will be removed,
  likely in 2.54.0.

  DEPRECATION MAY HAPPEN WITH LESS THAN TYPICAL NOTICE:
  lablgtk is difficult to use safely, and future maintenance is
  unclear.  Implementing the GUI without lablgtk requires more effort
  than seems likely to happen.  Thus, it is possible that support for
  the unison GUI may end suddenly, on a particular platform, or on all
  platforms -- even in a micro release.  See
    https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison/issues/1075  

  MAINTENANCE WARNING: No one is contributing to verify that the Mac
  GUI continues to work -- so it might not.  (So far, there are no
  reports of serious failures.)
