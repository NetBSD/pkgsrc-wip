The Universal Test Runner is a zero-configuration, language-aware way to
run unit tests in any project. It installs a command, `t`, which will
determine how to run your test suite (and then run it).

If you're working on a JS project, it runs `[your package manager here]
test`. You've run `pytest` in this folder before? `pytest` it is. Rust
project? `cargo test` coming right up. Is also clever about running all
your `go` module tests (regardless of how they're organized). No matter
the command, all args are passed directly into the test runner.
