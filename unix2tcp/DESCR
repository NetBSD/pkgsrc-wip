Aims:
* to listen on a local UNIX socket and tunnel any incoming connections and 
  traffic to a (remote) IP address/port

* tunnels all traffic between a (remote) address/port and a local UNIX socket
* does NOT use fork() (single process model)
* does use O_NONBLOCK , should be no case of blocking

What it doesnt do (yet):
* doesnt limit number of concurent connections
