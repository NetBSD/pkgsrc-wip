The script to start the server is particularly crap and should
probably be rewritten.

The server itself has a bug where it gets into a loop and becomes
unresponsive - the startup script handles this, but not very well.

Apart from that, this package works fine on NetBSD.

files/ contains some 3rd-party addons which may or may not be
useful.

-- This package has a known vulnerability, please investigate and fix if possible. (see: http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/unrwebdos-adv.txt and http://secunia.com/advisories/26506/)
