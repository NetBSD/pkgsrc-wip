uqwk collects all a user's unread news and/or mail, and formats it into
a packet for offline reading, saving telephone and connect charges.
Simple Offline Usenet Packet (SOUP), ZipNews, and the deprecated QWK
packet formats are supported. Mail can be read from classic Unix mbox
format mail files, MMDF mail files, or maildir mailboxes.
