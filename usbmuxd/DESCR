usbmuxd stands for "USB multiplexing daemon". This daemon is in charge of
multiplexing connections over USB to an iOS device.

The usbmuxd daemon is running upon installing iTunes on Windows and Mac OS
X. The libimobiledevice project provides an open-source reimplementation of
the usbmuxd daemon to use on other OSes or as an alternative to communicate
with iOS devices without the need to install iTunes.
