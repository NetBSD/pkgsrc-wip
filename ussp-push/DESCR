ussp-push is a OBEX object pusher for Linux, using the BlueZ BlueTooth stack.
The original ussp-push implementation required explicit binding to RFCOMM
channels before the usage, that made it quite cumbersome to use. I added
BlueTooth name resolution, and direct access to remote BlueTooth listening
channels.
