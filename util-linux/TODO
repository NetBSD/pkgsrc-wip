maybe fix hard-coded paths:
 /etc/adjtime in hwclock files
 /etc/issue in getty
 /etc/securetty for login
 /etc/shells in chsh
 /etc/TZ in simpleinit (maybe don't install it)
 /etc/shutdown.conf for shutdown
 /etc/nologin
 /etc/fstab
 /etc/mtab
 and others ...

# todo: make sure fdprm config is installed to correct CONF directory

have it use linux-kernel-headers buildlink3.mk file

some manpages and example fdprm have hard-coded paths

# todo: sometimes it installs pivot_root (and man) and sometimes not
# todo: set in MCONFIG HAVE_PAM=yes
# todo: maybe setterm only works if ...
#         vcterm = (!strncmp(term, "con", 3) || !strncmp(term, "linux", 5));
# todo: later add gettext support and enable NLS

# this doesn't install sln binary, but does install sln manpage
# sln is also in glibc-2.2.5
