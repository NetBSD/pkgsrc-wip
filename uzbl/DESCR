Uzbl is a set of web interface tools which adhere to the UNIX
philosophy. It consists of:
- uzbl-core: the main component which uses WebkitGtk+ for rendering
  and network interaction. It provides a plain web view and an
  optional status bar. It can be driven with scripts through standard
  input/output, named pipes, or sockets.
- uzbl-browser: a simple browser built atop uzbl-core. Provides means
  for url changing, keeping history, downloading files, filling forms,
  navigating links, managing cookies and events, etc. Uzbl-browser is
  highly customisable through a configuration file, which almost
  completely defines its behaviour.
- uzbl-tabbed: a multiplexer for uzbl-browsers. Allows keeping
  multiple instances of uzbl-browser in a single window.
