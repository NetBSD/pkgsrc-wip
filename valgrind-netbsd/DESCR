Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis
tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory
management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You
can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality
tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache
and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and
branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler. It also includes three
experimental tools: a heap/stack/global array overrun detector, a second
heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used, and a SimPoint basic
block vector generator. It runs on the following platforms: X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS/Linux,
ARM/Android (2.3.x and later), X86/Android (4.0 and later), X86/Darwin
and AMD64/Darwin (Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7, with limited support for 10.8).
