Vamps was written to make cheap backups of DVDs under Linux. Back in
2003 Metakine published the source code of their M2Requantiser module.
The idea was to make use of this great piece of software to create a
transcoder for Linux for shrinking the content of a DVD9. This would
enable backups on cheap single layer DVDRs (double layer burners weren't
even available that time). The Metakine requantizer is pretty fast and
so Vamps was designed not to break this outstanding performance.

Vamps builds a wrapper around the requantizer to extract the elementary
MPEG2 video stream from the DVD's program stream, feed it through the
requantizer and finally re-pack it into the program stream again.
Besides this, Vamps allows to select audio and subtitle streams that
should be copied into the output stream.  This gives another small gain
of disk space, since unwanted streams may be discarded.

Summed up, Vamps is only a very basic, but nevertheless essential tool
to transcode DVD videos to a smaller size. Vamps does not need to write
temporary data files, which is a major pro. Vamps is very fast. The
downside is, that Vamps is not capable to make DVD backups on its own.
