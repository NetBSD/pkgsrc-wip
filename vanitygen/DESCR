Vanitygen can generate regular bitcoin addresses, namecoin addresses,
and testnet addresses.

Vanitygen can search for exact prefixes or regular expression matches.
When searching for exact prefixes, vanitygen will ensure that the
prefix is possible, will provide a difficulty estimate, and will run
about 30% faster.  Exact prefixes are case-sensitive by default, but
may be searched case-insensitively using the "-i" option.  Regular
expression patterns follow the Perl-compatible regular expression
language.
