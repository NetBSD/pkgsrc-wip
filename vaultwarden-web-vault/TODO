Make this actually work; this is just an intermediary commit.

Figure out how this relates to the web server that is optional in
security/vaultwarden.  Probably there should be only one way to get a
web server, or there should be a way to get original vs patched in a
parallel way.  The answer might be adding this package and dropping
the web server from security/vaultwarden, but I don't want to jump to
conclusions in a TODO entry.

Adjust DESCR to make it clear that this is downloading precompiled js,
vs building the bits to be downloaded from source.  I'm not saying
that is terrible, but this is pkgsrc not pkgbin so users should
understand that from DESCR.  Or if I'm confused and that's not what's
going on, add enough text to unconfuse people like me :-)
