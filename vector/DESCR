Vector is a high-performance, end-to-end (agent & aggregator)
observability data pipeline that puts you in control of your
observability data. Collect, transform, and route all your logs and
metrics to any vendors you want today and any other vendors you may
want tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel data
enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most
convenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to
10x faster than every alternative in the space.
