Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore
your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. You can run
Velero with a public cloud platform or on-premises. Velero lets you:

 - Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
 - Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
 - Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.

Velero consists of:

 - A server that runs on your cluster
 - A command-line client that runs locally
