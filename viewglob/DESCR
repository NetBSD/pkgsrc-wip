viewglob is a utility designed to complement the Unix shell in
graphical environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the shell and X
	  terminal, keeping track of the user's current directory
	  and command line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories
	  referenced on the command line (including pwd).

The display also shows the results of file globs and expansions as
they are typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and
potential name completions.
