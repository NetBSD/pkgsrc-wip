VNC (Virtual Network Computing) software makes it possible to view and
fully-interact with one computer from any other computer or mobile device
anywhere on the Internet.  VNC software is cross-platform, allowing remote
control between different types of computer.

VNC has a wide range of applications including system administration, IT
support and helpdesks.  It can also be used to support the mobile user, both
for hot desking within the enterprise and also to provide remote access at
home, or on the road.  The system allows several connections to the same
desktop, providing an invaluable tool for collaborative or shared working in
the workplace or classroom.  Computer support within the geographically spread
family is an ever popular use.

Vino is an VNC server that integrates cleanly within the GNOME Desktop.
