Virtual Jaguar is software dedicated to emulating the Atari Jaguar
hardware on a standard PC. The software was originally developed
by David Raingeard of Potato Emulation.

Virtual Jaguar GCC/SDL is not only a port of the MS Visual C++/SDL
sourcecode but has also been extended and rewritten so that we can
enjoy Atari Jaguar emulation on every platform which uses the GCC
compiler and that can make use of the Simple Directmedia Layer
library (SDL).
