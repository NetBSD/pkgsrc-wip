This is a virtual keyboard for AWE, MIDI and ALSA drivers.
It's a simple fake of a MIDI keyboard on X-windows system.
Enjoy a music with your mouse and "computer" keyboard :-)

The program requires Tcl7.5/Tk4.1 or newer libraries.
This program supports:
  - ALSA sequencer (ver.0.5.x or 0.9.x)
  - AWE driver on OSS  (ver.0.4.3)
  - MIDI device on OSS and ALSA
Since the most of the part is written by Tcl/Tk script, it'll be not
so difficult to apply this program to other systems.
