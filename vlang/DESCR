The V programming language.

Key Features of V:
    Simplicity: the language can be learned in less than an hour
    Fast compilation:
    -110k loc/s with a Clang backend,
    -1 million loc/s with native and tcc backends
     (Intel i5-7500, SSD, no optimization) (demo video)
    Easy to develop: V compiles itself in less than a second
    Performance: as fast as C (V's main backend compiles to human readable C)
    Safety: no null, no globals, no undefined behavior, immutability by default
    C to V translation
    Hot code reloading
    Innovative memory management (demo video)
    Cross-platform UI library
    Built-in graphics library
    Easy cross compilation
    REPL
