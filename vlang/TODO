TODO: the repl wants a writable ${INSTALLDIR}/cmd/tools directory.

TODO: some tests (${WRKSRC}/v test-all) fail with missing headers
      and/or libraries, or some real failures (but most of the tests pass).

TODO: Type net.Addr (a network address) seems not to get defined.

TODO: Uses 'pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()' which NetBSD doesn't seem to
implement.
I patched it out. Should be upstreamed somehow, cleanly.

TODO: several tests fail with signal 11: segmentation fault, possibly
      related to signals:
