VLevel keeps your music from making you jump out of your seat, and it keeps you
from having to fiddle with the volume constantly. It's different from other
dynamic compressors because it looks ahead. You can think of VLevel as someone
who knows your music by heart, and turns the volume up during quiet passages,
but smoothly turns it back down when he knows a loud part is coming. It's great
for making CDs to listen to in your car, or to play background music on your
computer.

VLevel is currently a LADSPA plugin and a command-line filter. You can use it
with many Linux audio programs including XMMS, GStreamer, GLAME, GDAM, and
others, and you can use it in shell scripts to level your music before burning
a CD. In the future, it may be ported to other audio programs like SOX and
WinAMP, and it will be made generally easier to use.
