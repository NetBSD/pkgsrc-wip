- Actually it can be built on NetBSD, but there are some problems:

	* xenctld does not work yet (the code is clearly using linux'isms)
	* documentation files are not installed atm, fixme.
	* maybe do we want to install the script files as well?
	* test all commands extensively.
	* fix patch-ac, it has hardcoded the PAGE_SIZE value which is
	  really wrong on !i386.
