Tool for attaching simply to VMware Fusion Serial Consoles.

VMware Fusion will, if appropriately coerced, emulate UARTs in
guests and expose them to the host as UNIX domain sockets. This
tool allows you to attach your terminal emulator directly to one
of those sockets without having to lark about with socat and screen.

Also works well with a VirtualBox host and a NetBSD guest.
