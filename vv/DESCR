vv - terminal image viewer

With vv you can display image files directly in your terminal. This
works both locally and over remote connections. An extensive range
of modern image formats is supported. Image data is displayed in
full color, without any color space reduction or dithering. Images
are scaled to fit the available space in the terminal. Small images
can be upscaled.
