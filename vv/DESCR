![Screenshot](doc/img1.png)

</div>

With vv you can display image files directly in your terminal. This works both locally and over remote connections. An extensive range of modern image formats is supported. Image data is displayed in full color, without any color space reduction or dithering. Images are scaled to fit the available space in the terminal. Small images can be upscaled.

## Image formats

The following types of image files can be viewed in vv:

- BC (Block Compression, also known as DXTC, S3TC), in DDS container,
- OpenEXR,
- HEIF (High Efficiency Image File Format),
- AVIF (AV1 Image File Format),
- JPEG,
- JPEG XL,
...
