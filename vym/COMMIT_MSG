vym: Update from 2.7.1 to 2.8.8

https://www.insilmaril.de/vym/release-notes-2.8.0.html

Release notes View Your Mind - vym 2.8.0

This version provides bugfixes and some new features. The biggest and most
visible change are the (mostly) reworked and now scalable icons in mind maps.

At least on Linux you now can also connect to JIRA and Confluence and retrieve
data, but also create or update Confluence pages.

A brandnew feature is the (experimental) support to import and export Firefox
bookmarks - very handy to sort bigger bookmark collections.

Scripting still is considered as Technology Preview - APIs still might change
in upcoming versions, when vym will be based on Qt6. Just check out the
keyboard macros for F01 to F24 or also the example scripts.

The lists below list differences between vym 2.7.0 and 2.8.0.

Thanks for using vym!
