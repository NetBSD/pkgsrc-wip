Wargus is a Warcraft2 mod that allows you to play Warcraft2 with the
Stratagus engine. The game looks and sounds exactly like Warcraft2. The
gameplay is very close to Warcraft2's gameplay, with slight enhancements
towards Starcraft. You can find more details on Wargus and on how to install
it under Linux, Windows and Mac at http://wargus.github.io.
