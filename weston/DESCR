Weston is a very basic desktop, the reference implementation of a Wayland
compositor. Shows a wallpaper under its semi-transparent launcher panel
with a clock. Takes over a text console, or starts a nested window
instance inside an existing session. Renders to a framebuffer device or an
EGL direct rendering context. Has a screenshooter and a terminal emulator.

Needs wip/udev once at runtime, see its DESCR for details.
