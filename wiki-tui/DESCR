A simple and easy to use Wikipedia Text User Interface.

wiki-tui currently has these features:
-Browse through Wikipedia (Set the language by changing the url in the config)
-Uses webscraping and a custom view to display wikipedia articles in the
terminal
-Use links to open other articles

These features are planned:
-View and interact with more elements of wikipedia articles (like tables,
images, etc.)
-Better error handling
