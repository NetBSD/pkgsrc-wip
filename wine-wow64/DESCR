Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on
several POSIX-compliant operating systems. Instead of simulating internal
Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows
API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory
penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows
applications into your desktop.

This package tracks the Wine stable branch.

On 32-bit systems this package supports only 32-bit applications, and on
64-bit systems it supports only 64-bit applications.
