Wine is a program which facilitates running Microsoft Windows Programs
on Unix. It acts as a compatibility layer by translating Windows API
calls into POSIX calls on the fly; thereby allowing you to run Windows
Applications on your UNIX desktop.

Note: This package is intended to build wine for x86_64 with WoW64 support.
