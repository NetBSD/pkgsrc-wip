Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer, or "sniffer", for Unix and
Unix-like operating systems.  It uses GTK+, a graphical user interface
library, and libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

The Wireshark distribution also comes with TShark, which is a
line-oriented sniffer (similar to Sun's snoop, or tcpdump) that uses the
same dissection, capture-file reading and writing, and packet filtering
code as Wireshark, and with editcap, which is a program to read capture
files and write the packets from that capture file, possibly in a
different capture file format, and with some packets possibly removed
from the capture.

This package tracks version 2 stable branch.
