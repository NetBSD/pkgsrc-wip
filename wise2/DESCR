	Wise2 is a package focused on comparisons of bio polymers, commonly DNA
sequence and protein sequence. Wise2's particular forte is the comparison
of DNA sequence at the level of its protein translation. This comparison
allows the simultaneous prediction of say gene structure with homology
based alignment.
	Wise2 also contains other algorithms, such as the venerable Smith-Waterman
algorithm, or more modern ones such as Stephen Altschul's generalised gap
penalties, or even experimental ones developed in house, such as dba.
