Wise2 is a package focused on comparisons of bio polymers, commonly DNA
sequence and protein sequence. Wise2's particular forte is the
comparison of DNA sequence at the level of its protein translation. This
comparison allows the simultaneous prediction of say gene structure with
homology based alignment.

Wise2 also contains other algorithms, such as the venerable
Smith-Waterman algorithm, or more modern ones such as Stephen Altschul's
generalised gap penalties, or even experimental ones developed in house,
such as dba.
