# wlroots

Pluggable, composable, unopinionated modules for building a
[Wayland](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor; or about 50,000 lines of
code you were going to write anyway.

- wlroots provides backends that abstract the underlying display and input
	hardware, including KMS/DRM, libinput, Wayland, X11, and headless backends,
	plus any custom backends you choose to write, which can all be created or
	destroyed at runtime and used in concert with each other.
- wlroots provides unopinionated, mostly standalone implementations of many
	Wayland interfaces, both from wayland.xml and various protocol extensions.
	We also promote the standardization of portable extensions across
	many compositors.
- wlroots provides several powerful, standalone, and optional tools that
	implement components common to many compositors, such as the arrangement of
	outputs in physical space.
- wlroots provides an Xwayland abstraction that allows you to have excellent
	Xwayland support without worrying about writing your own X11 window manager
	on top of writing your compositor.
