Wlroots implements a huge variety of Wayland compositor
features and implements them right, so you can focus on
the features that make your compositor unique. By using
wlroots, you get high performance, excellent hardware
compatibility, broad support for many wayland interfaces,
and comfortable development tools - or any subset of
these features you like, because all of them work
independently of one another and freely compose with
anything you want to implement yourself.
