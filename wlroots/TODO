* Can't build on NetBSD-10 with native x11, libdrm is too old:

Dependency libdrm found: NO. Found 2.4.109 but need: '>=2.4.122'
WARNING: Found CMake '/usr/pkgsrc/wip/wlroots/work/.tools/bin/false' but couldn't run it
Found CMake: NO
Run-time dependency libdrm found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
Looking for a fallback subproject for the dependency libdrm
ERROR: Subproject libdrm is buildable: NO

#NOTE: NetBSD-11 already has 2.4.124

* On NetBSD-10 with X11_TYPE=modular (and pkgsrc's libdrm-2.4.128) builds fine, but: 

1) egl render doesn't work on NetBSD-10:
libdrm's drmGetBusid() use DRM_IOCTL_GET_UNIQUE on render node, what is allowed
with https://github.com/NetBSD/src/commit/003bb55d1d411ad2e8cf728c2e7a57f0348e97e6,
available from netbsd-11

#NOTE: should restart on NetBSD-11 with native X11?
