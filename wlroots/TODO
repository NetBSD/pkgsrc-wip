* Can't build on NetBSD with native x11, libdrm is too old:

Dependency libdrm found: NO. Found 2.4.109 but need: '>=2.4.122'
WARNING: Found CMake '/usr/pkgsrc/wip/wlroots/work/.tools/bin/false' but couldn't run it
Found CMake: NO
Run-time dependency libdrm found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
Looking for a fallback subproject for the dependency libdrm
ERROR: Subproject libdrm is buildable: NO

* On NetBSD-10 with X11_TYPE=modular builds fine, but not tested yet
