wmctrl is a command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X
Window Manager.

It provides command line access to almost all the features defined in the EWMH
specification.  Using it, it's possible to, for example, obtain information
about the window manager, get a detailed list of desktops and managed windows,
switch and resize desktops, change number of desktops, make windows
full-screen, always-above or sticky, and activate, close, move, resize,
maximize and minimize them.

The command line access makes it easy to automate these tasks and execute them
from any application that is able to run a command in response to some event.
