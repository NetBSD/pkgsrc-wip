Workrave is a program that assists in the recovery and prevention
of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). The program frequently alerts
you to take micro-pauses, rest breaks and restricts you to your
daily limit.  Workrave is able to run distributed across one or
more PCs, sharing timing information.  It is also able to be embedded
as an applet in the system tray.
