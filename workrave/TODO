  * what's the proper way to cause proper definitions of vfwscanf,
    vswscanf, vwscanf, and wcstof? In NetBSD's /usr/include/wchar.h,
    these are conditional on either _ISOC99_SOURCE, _NETBSD_SOURCE
    or __STDC_VERSION__, none of which are defined normally.
    (Required to compile backend/src/Break.cc)

  * Test different frontend/backends:

    Tested:
	PKG_OPTIONS.workrave='gtk gconf'
	PKG_OPTIONS.workrave='gtk xml'

    Untested:
	PKG_OPTIONS.workrave='gnome'
