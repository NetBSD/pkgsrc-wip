WenQuanYi Micro Hei is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei, Gothic
or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality CJK
outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback" and "Droid
Sans" released by Google Inc. This font contains all the unified CJK
Han glyphs in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard
5.1, together with many other languages unicode blocks, including
Latins, Extended Latins, Hanguls and Kanas. The font file is
extremely compact (~4M) compared with most known CJK fonts. As a
result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
used for PC with a significantly small memory footprint.
