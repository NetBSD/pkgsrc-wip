1. Previous problem, missing sfftw_* symbol, is resolved by adding
   PKG_OPTIONS.fftw+=     fftw-fortran
   and packaged fine on NetBSD/amd64 9.3

2. On NetBSD/amd64 9.3 (and 10.99.12) Now getting at starting
   'wsjtx' failed: Cannot allocate memory

3. On NetBSD/amd64 10.99.12 (pbulk) had not been packaged  with
    ..
    ERROR: bin/wsjtx: missing library: libgomp.so.1
    ..
    etc,
  The work around is asking gcc 14, and now packaged.

4. Riastradh@ told following test
