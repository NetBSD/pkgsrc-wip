This program needs two things:

1. When math/fftw is packaged,
   PKG_OPTIONS.fftw+=     fftw-fortran
  is required, and this is not default,
  pbulk will fail as BROKEN package

  Thanks IrisZzz at #pkgsrc on irc

2. Requires huge memory,
2.1
   on NetBSD 10.99.12
     ulimit -d 524288
   is required on the shell to start
2.2
   on NetBSD 9.3 both hard and soft limit should be raised by
     su -l root -c "sysctl -w proc.$$.rlimit.datasize.hard=536870912"
   ulimit -d 524288
   (536870912 = 1024 * 524288)

  524,288 is for an example, not fully tested.

2.3
   If above operation is on zsh and you have problems, probably you 
   may have suffered  from zsh cacheing issue on above limits.
   Please try the same thing with sh (bin/sh). 

   Thanks Riastradh@ to have figured out item 2 above 

3. To find where to document above 2 notes
