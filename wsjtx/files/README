This program needs several things

1. When math/fftw is packaged,
   PKG_OPTIONS.fftw+=     fftw-fortran
  is required, and this is not default,
  pbulk will fail as BROKEN package

  Thanks IrisZzz at #pkgsrc on irc

2. Requires huge memory,
2.1
   on NetBSD 10.99.12
     ulimit -d 524288
   is required on the shell to start
2.2
   on NetBSD 9.3 both hard and soft limit should be raised by
     su -l root -c "sysctl -w proc.$$.rlimit.datasize.hard=536870912"
   ulimit -d 524288
   (536870912 = 1024 * 524288)

  524,288 is for an example, not fully tested.

2.3
   If above operation is with zsh and you have problems, probably you 
   may have suffered  from zsh cacheing issue on above limits.
   Please try the same thing with sh (bin/sh). 

   Thanks Riastradh@ to have figured out item 2 above 

3.  Rig control serial device  /dev/dtyU0 Permission
   USB rig control will be done by serial device.
   It usually be done with dev/dtyU0. The permission may be -r--r--r--
   which you can not send rig control. One work around is
     chmod 644 /dev/dtyU0
   If you run wsjtx by root, it communicates without a permission change,
   but in that case, audio selection may not appear at
      File -> Settings -> Audio

4.  Audio settings:
   Sample rate:
   You may need following setup for sound card to sync to necessary rate.
   Following is just an example. Please modify the first '1' to select audio
   device correctly. That number is, I'd say, audiocfg reference number and 
   it appears at the left most column at audiocfg list. See audiocfg(1). 
   Watch the 'record:' setting to sync decode part at following operation.
   ---------------------------------------
    netbsd-nuc# audiocfg list 1
    1: [*] audio3 @ uaudio1: USB audio
            playback: 2ch, 44100Hz
            record:   2ch, 48000Hz
            (P-) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, { 44100 }
            (P-) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, { 44100 }
            (-R) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, 8000-48000Hz

    netbsd-nuc# audiocfg set 1 r slinear_le 16 2 44100
    setting audio3 to slinear_le:16, 2ch, 44100Hz

    netbsd-nuc# audiocfg list 1
    1: [*] audio3 @ uaudio1: USB audio
            playback: 2ch, 44100Hz
            record:   2ch, 44100Hz
            (P-) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, { 44100 }
            (P-) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, { 44100 }
            (-R) slinear_le 16/16, 2ch, 8000-48000Hz

5. jt9 crash:
   If wsjtx stops by accident, a trace of shared memory may be left out and in that
   situation, you may get jt9 to crash.
   Try
      sudo ipcrm -m all
   to remove the trace mentioned above.

6. 40 m band USB or LSB.
   It seems to me, if the band is changed to 40 m, the mode may be set as LSB,
   but USB is required for FT8, in that case, I would change it
   manually on rig to USB.

7. To decode correctly, the clock (time) is very important. Make sure
   ntpd is running correctly or run ntpdate at booting.
