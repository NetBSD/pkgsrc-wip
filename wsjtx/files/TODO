This program needs several things

1. When math/fftw is packaged,
   PKG_OPTIONS.fftw+=     fftw-fortran
  is required, and this is not default,
  pbulk will fail as BROKEN package

  Thanks IrisZzz at #pkgsrc on irc

2. Requires huge memory,
2.1
   on NetBSD 10.99.12
     ulimit -d 524288
   is required on the shell to start
2.2
   on NetBSD 9.3 both hard and soft limit should be raised by
     su -l root -c "sysctl -w proc.$$.rlimit.datasize.hard=536870912"
   ulimit -d 524288
   (536870912 = 1024 * 524288)

  524,288 is for an example, not fully tested.

2.3
   If above operation is on zsh and you have problems, probably you 
   may have suffered  from zsh cacheing issue on above limits.
   Please try the same thing with sh (bin/sh). 

   Thanks Riastradh@ to have figured out item 2 above 

3.  /dev/dtyU0 Permission
   USB rig control will be done by serial device.
   It usually be /dev/dtyU0. The permission may be -r--r--r--
   which you can not send rig control. One work around is
     chmod 644 /dev/dtyU0
   If you run wsjtx by root, it communicates without permission change,
   but in that case, audio selection may not appear.

4.  Audio settings:
   sample rate issue:
   You may need following setup for sound card to sync to necessary rate
   Following is just example. Please modify the first '1' to select audio
   device correctly.

5. If wsjtx stops by accident shared memory, a trace may be left out and in that
   situation, you may get jt9 to crash.
   Try
      sudo ipcrm -m all
   to remove the trace mentioned above.

6. 40 m band USB or LSB.
   It seems to me, if the band is changed to 40 m, the mode may be LSB,
   but USB is required for that band, in the mean time, I would change it
   manually.
