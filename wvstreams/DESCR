WvStreams is a network programming library in C++. It was constructed over the
lifetime of the NetIntegrator mostly by apenwarr but also with tons of help
from dcoombs and other members of Net Integration R&D. The version of
WvStreams you see on this site is currently maintained by the AlumNit group.

WvStreams aims to be an efficient, secure, easy-to-use, and OS-independent
library for doing network applications development, and we think that it has
pretty much lived up to those goals. Currently all or parts of it work under
Linux, *BSD, Solaris, and MAC OS X. Some parts have been ported to Windows,
with a more complete port coming really soon.

Most people who have read WvStreams-based code seem to be very impressed with
how readable it makes application programs. It would have been impossible to
build WvDial, TunnelVision, Retchmail, and the rest of the programs found on
this site as quickly as we did without a good framework library.

Currently, what documentation exists is a bit sporadic. The header files from
the source code are fairly well documented, and, for those looking for examples,
all of the programs on this site have been developed using this library, so you
should be able to get some ideas from them.
