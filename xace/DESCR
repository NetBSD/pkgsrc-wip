This emulator is made by Edward Patel. The Jupiter ACE
is the real *outsider* micro from the 80's. Instead of having
BASIC as the programming language it had FORTH. It was designed
by two guys how had worked at Sinclair Research Ltd and was
responsible for the famous Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.
They are Steven Vickers and Richard Altwasser.
