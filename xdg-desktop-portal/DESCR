A portal frontend service for Flatpak and possibly other desktop
containment frameworks.

xdg-desktop-portal works by exposing a series of D-Bus interfaces
known as _portals_ under a well-known name (org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop)
and object path (/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop).

The portal interfaces include APIs for file access, opening URIs,
printing and others.
