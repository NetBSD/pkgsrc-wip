The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic
desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux.

They are intended to provide a set of defacto standards. This means
that:

* Third party software developers can rely on these xdg-utils for
all of their simple integration needs.

* Developers of desktop environments can make sure that their
environments are well supported

If a desktop developer wants to be certain that their environment
functions with all third party software, then can simply make sure
that these utilities work properly in their environment.  This will
hopefully mean that 'third tier' window managers such as XFCE and
Blackbox can reach full parity with Gnome and KDE in terms of third
party ISV support.

* Distribution vendors can provide custom versions of these utilities

If a distribution vendor wishes to have unusual systems, they can
provide custom scripts, and the third party software should still
continue to work.
