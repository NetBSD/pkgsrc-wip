This is a build of XEmacs from today's repository head.
It is by definition unstable. Use at your own risk.

XEmacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
display editor.

Users new to XEmacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly
by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.
XEmacs also has an extensive interactive manual browser.  It is easily
extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

For a wide range of modes and extensions, also install
editors/xemacs-packages.
