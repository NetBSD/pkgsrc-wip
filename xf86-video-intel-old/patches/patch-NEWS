-Release 2.7.1 (2009-05-12)
---------------------------
-This is a maintenance release on the 2.7 branch. Compared to 2.7.0 it
-consists only of a few carefully hand-picked fixes for bugs,
-(including GPU crashers). We encourage all users of 2.7.0 to upgrade
-to 2.7.1.
-
-Bug fixes since 2.7.0:
-
-    * KMS: Hook up output properties for RANDR, (this allows output
-      properties to be controlled in the KMS case just as in the UMS
-      case). [Zhenyu Wang <zhenyu.z.wang@intel.com>]
-
-    * Fix multiplication error when computing required batch space.
-      This could fix any number of cases where the driver did
-      inexplicable things (due to having computed the wrong
-      size). [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]
-
-    * Hold reference to video binding table until all rects are
-      painted. This prevent general chaos in the buffer
-      manager. [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]
-
-    * Split i915 textured video commands to fit into batch
-      buffers. Video and 3D setup commands share the same batch
-      buffer, so without this fix, various problems could occur when
-      video and 3D clients were both heavily active at the same
-      time. [Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>]
-
-    * Fix crash with XV with large virtual display (> 2049). [Albert
-      Damen <albrt@gmx.net>]
-
-    * Provide missing value to 3D_STATE_VERTEX_BUFFERS command. We
-      don't know that this was causing any problem, but the change
-      does bring the driver into conformance with what the
-      specification says the hardware requires here. [Keith Packard
-      <keithp@keithp.com>]

 Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
 --------------------------
 Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
@@ -56,16 +19,6 @@ this release, which should give the best
 robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
 used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).
 
-Known issue:
-
-	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
-	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
-	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
-	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
-	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
-	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
-	above will have working PAT code.

 Some of the most notable bugs fixed in 2.7.0 include:
 
 	[GM45 965GM] bad htotal causes panel startup failure
