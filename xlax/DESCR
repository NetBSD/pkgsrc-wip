xlax is an X11 input multiplexer: it sends your keyboard input from the
xlax window to a group of windows simultaneously. The tool is designed
for system administrators who typically have to do the same thing on
several machines (or in several different directories).
Windows can be added or deleted interactively, or temporarily
disconnected and reconnected. xlax allows you to assign a custom string
to each window (e.g. a hostname) that can be sent with a button click.
An included script handles starting up and arranging windows, and allows
you to set up commonly used window groupings in a config file.
