xmatchview, xmatchview-conifer and xmatchview-hive are imaging tools
for visualizing DNA/RNA sequence synteny. It allows users to align 2
(or 3) sequences in FASTA format using cross_match, minimap2 or any
aligners with .paf output capabilities, and displays the alignments in
a variety of image formats (png, tiff). xmatchview-hive outputs
xml-scalable vector graphics (svg).
