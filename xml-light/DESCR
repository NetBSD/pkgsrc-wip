Xml-Light is a minimal XML parser and printer for OCaml. It provides functions
to parse an XML document into an OCaml data structure, work with it, and print
it back to an XML document. It also supports DTD parsing and checking, and is
entirely written in OCaml, hence it does not require additional C library.
