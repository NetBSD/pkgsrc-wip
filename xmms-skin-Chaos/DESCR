[ DESIGNER NOTES ]

Thanks to artwiz for his excellent chaos theme for BlackBox - I never
would have made this skin (obviously! :) if not for his theme.  I would
just like to make it clear though, that I did all the graphics myself,
from scratch, using artwiz' screenshot as reference - I didn't 'rip'
anything. ;)

I liked artwiz' chaos theme so much that I ported it to LiteStep - you can
find the port (which also includes a matching WindowBlinds skin) at
ohussain.tripod.com, along with my other themes.

You know, the LiteStep community has gotten sooo much from the X community,
I hope that this skin is taken as a _teeny_ _tiny_ gift from the LiteStep
community to the X community... ;)

Thank you for downloading this skin. :)
