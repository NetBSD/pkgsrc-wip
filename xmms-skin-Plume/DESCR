Plume XMMS Skin v1
==================

With this skin I've tried to mimic the user interface of plasma screens,
where only few colors and few space are available. Hope you'll like it!

Thanks to:
- SMAR (SMAR2K@hotmail.com) for its Amp X-Treme WinAmp skin upon which is
  based this XMMS skin.
- Jesse Kaufman (glandix@linuxfreak.com) for its NeXTAmp3 skin, from which
  I've taken some ideas.

To install this skin, simply put the skin file (Plume-XMMS-vXX.tgz)
into your ~/.xmms/Skins directory.
