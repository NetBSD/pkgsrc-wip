  I made my first  Winamp X skin.  I was inspired  my the new
  Mac OS8 X Aqua  interface.  Some of the  elements look like
  the OS and others are made custom. All credits  go to Apple
  for makind such an amazing Operating System.

  Please make  any comments  or any  suggestion  to make this
  skin look better, by keeping the Aqua interface. To contact
  me, send and e-Mail to deelight@flashmail.com
