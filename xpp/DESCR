The X Printing Panel (XPP) is a completely free tool that interfaces with
the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) for easy choosing of the desired
printer out of a list of all available printers and for setting printer
options by and easy-to-use graphical user interface.  One simply calls the
program (xpp) instead of the usual utilities (lpr or lp) at the command
line or out of applications.
