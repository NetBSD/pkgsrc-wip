Write a rc.d script
 - mostly done, but should sesman (and it's variables) rather be named
   xrdp_sesman?
 - is BEFORE: xrdp really required in sesman.sh?

Replace hardcoded paths (see patch-ai and xrdp_control.sh)
 - patch-ai is tricky, maybe default to what $PATH was before clearing the
   environment?

Get rid of xrdp_control.sh and startwm.sh (at least in $PREFIX/bin):
 - startwm.sh could be replaced by ~/.xinitrc
 - xrdp_control.sh is essentially what the rc-script does

try it
 - it works, but requires further testing, and login is still not possible
   (testing this on Debian testing right now)

CFGDIR is duplicate in MAKE_ENV

Add version information to libraries?

Make sesman log to a sane default location (syslog?) rather than ./sesman.log

Linux: Figure out why DLLIB or any other -ldl specific variable is never set.
- might have been fixed by update to 0.5.0, because autoconf may autodetect it; needs testing

Old (from lkundrak, the previous maintainer, and not totally clear to me, the
new maintainer):
- pam && kerberos optional
  (why? how?)
  - Might work by using the options framework and tweaking autoconf parameters
- MESSAGE
  (I don't know why, but it was here before)
- fix bugs such as -n one 
  (I don't know what it means, but I assume it's the mismatch whether the
  parameter is called -nodaemon (as in reality) or -n (as in the manpage))

Possible vulnerabilites to investigate:
