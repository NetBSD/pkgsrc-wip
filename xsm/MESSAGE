For further or complete functionality, install the session manager
proxy, smproxy, for applications that don't support R6 style session
management; iceauth for storing and retrieving ICE authentication
information; rstart for allowing xsm to start applications on remote
machines; and a window manager supporting R6 style session management,
like twm, or window configurations will not be saved for the
sessions.
