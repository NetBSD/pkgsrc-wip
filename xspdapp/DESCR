The eXtended Server Pages project is a very fast application server based on
C-code. The programming environment supports application programs of the
following kinds:

      * C-programs (well tested, running at production conditions since May
	2003)
      * shell scripts (well tested)
      * C++-programs (using the supported C-library, tested)
      * Java-programs (well tested, using the supported C-library via JNI)

All different kind of application programs may be mixed within the same session
context. Java programs may use different Java runtime environments or versions
and can be mixed within the same session context.

The XSPD is not another Java based application server. The main advantages of
the XSPD are:

      * Small and fast core program code (C based).
      * High performance with typical more than 1000 session requests per
	second (less than 1 msec per request) and throughput with up to 4
	MByte/sec per request.
      * Usage of fast C/C++ based application programs with the same
	programming techniques like JSP servlet programming.
      * Support of session context for shell based scripts also.
