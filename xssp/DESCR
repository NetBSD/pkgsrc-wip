Software for creating DSSP and HSSP files.
DSSP is a database of secondary structure assignments (and much more) for all
protein entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). DSSP is also the program that
calculates DSSP entries from PDB entries. DSSP does not predict secondary
structure.
HSSP is a database that combines structural and sequence information about
proteins. This database has the information of the alignment of all available
homologs of proteins from the PDB database As a result of this, HSSP is also a
database of homology-based implied protein structures
