xt is a cross-format translator for JSON, YAML, TOML, and MessagePack.

xt is built to do one thing well, and tries to maintain a minimal interface and
feature set.
The most common options are -t to specify an output format other than JSON, and
one or more files to read from rather than standard input.

Some of xt's notable features include:
 - Automatic Format Detection
   When the input format is not specified with the -f option, xt can detect it
   automatically by file extension, or by examining the content of the input
   stream itself.
 - Multi-Document Support
   With most output formats, xt can translate multiple input files, each
   containing one or more independent documents, to a single output stream.
   For example, a set of YAML files with documents separated by --- markers can
   translate to a single stream of newline-delimited JSON objects. With format
   detection enabled, xt can even translate input files in different formats to
   a single output.
 - Streaming Translation
   xt can translate multi-document inputs from unbounded sources like shell
   pipes with minimal buffering, while still supporting features like automatic
   format detection. Streaming is enabled automatically whenever it's required.
