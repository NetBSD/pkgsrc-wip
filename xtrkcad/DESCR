XTrackCAD is a CAD program for designing model railroad layouts.

Using it, you can
 +  Design layouts in any scale and gauge,
 +  Use the predefined libraries for many popular brands of turnouts to
    help you get started easily,
 +  Add your own favorite components,
 +  Manipulate track much like you would with actual flex-track to
    modify, extend and join tracks and turnouts,
 +  Test your design by running trains, including picking them up and
    moving them with the mouse.
 +  At any point you can print the design in a scale of your choice.
    When printed in 1:1 scale the printout can be used as a template for
    laying the track to build your dream layout.
 +  Learning XTrackCAD is made easy with the extensive on-line help and
    demonstrations.
