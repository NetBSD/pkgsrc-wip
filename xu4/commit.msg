xu4: Update to 1.4.2 (wip)

Current attempts:
* SDL backend seems to be unmaintained upstream.
* devel/allegro5 seems to be broken on NetBSD.
* wip/glfw seems to be broken on NetBSD.

TODO:
* Try package glv as a "last change" backend or
  try to fix another SDL, allegro5 or glfw
* Package games/ultima-data
