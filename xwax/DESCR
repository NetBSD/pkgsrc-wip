xwax is an open-source Digital Vinyl System (DVS). It allows DJs and
turntablists to playback digital audio files (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC
and more), controlled using a normal pair of turntables via timecoded vinyls.

It's designed for both beat mixing and scratch mixing. Needle drops, pitch
changes, scratching, spinbacks and rewinds are all supported, and feel just
like the audio is pressed onto the vinyl itself.

The focus is on an accurate vinyl feel which is efficient, stable and fast.
