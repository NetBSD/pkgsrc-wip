Imaging that you are looking into the glass from the top. You see four walls
and the bottom. The flat 2d figures falling down from the walls one by one.
You can move these figures from one wall to another or rotate them. If the
figure leave the wall then it moves on the bottom while another figure is
pushed. You need to form full rows and/or columns on the bottom. When you form
such row, it disappear and you receive additional empty space on the bottom
and scores :). The more rows disappear at a time, the more scores you have. If
you can't place the whole figure on the bottom, then it stays on the wall and
this wall became frozen (you can't place figures on it) for a while. After nth
rows were successfully cleared, you will receive bonus figure and go to to the
next level - game speed will be increased. Your task is to play more longer
and earn more scores.

The game options allow you to play with two,three,four,five or six piece
figures, mix them together, show next figure and switch on rotation of the
game board! Try it, it's very funny.
