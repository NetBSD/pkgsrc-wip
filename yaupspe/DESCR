YAUPSPE (Yet Another PSP Emulator) is a small prototype of PSP emulator. It's
not usable yet. It's based on Potemkin, a multiplatform (but mostly PSP)
emulator under the GPL-2 license, abandoned by its main developer. YAUPSPE is a
cleaned up version of it, using C, and cross-platform (it should work on all the
platforms where SDL works).
