v25.5.28
Breaking Changes

    [manager] is deprecated in favor of the new [mgr]. #2803
    tab_width has been removed as it no longer needs to be set manually. #2745
    tab_active and tab_inactive are moved under the new [tabs] section. #2745
    sixel_fraction has been removed as it's no longer needed. #2707

Deprecated

    ya.mgr_emit(), ya.app_emit() and ya.input_emit() are deprecated. #2653
    ya.preview_widgets() is deprecated. #2706
    Command:args() is deprecated. #2752
    The ya pack subcommand is deprecated. #2770
    LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT on ui.Line, ui.Text are deprecated. #2802
    NONE, TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, ALL on ui.Bar, ui.Border are deprecated. #2802
    WRAP_NO, WRAP, WRAP_TRIM on ui.Text are deprecated. #2802

Redesign Tabs

#2745 decouples tabs from the header into an independent tab bar component to enhance UX:

    A standalone single-line component increases the available space for displaying tabs.
    Tab titles are displayed by default to increase recognizability.
    Supports switching tabs via mouse for easier navigation.

The new tab bar is only shown when there is more than one tab, ensuring no space is wasted for users who don't use tabs.

Calculate Real-Time Directory Size in Spotter

#2695 adds directory sizes to the folder spotter. The size is computed dynamically in real time and asynchronously, which means:

    Every time a user clicks <Tab> on a directory, the latest size is calculated.
    For large directories, real-time changes in size are reported to the user, with "(?)" appended at the end to indicate that the calculation is in progress.
    If the user closes the spotter or switches directories using the left/right arrow keys, any ongoing calculations will be canceled to avoid wasting resources.

Also, the computed directory size will be updated in the file list:

    If the user sets linemode = size, the latest size will be shown on the right of the file line.
    If the user sets sort_by = size, the file list will be sorted by the latest sizes (if necessary).

9x Faster Sixel Image Preview

#2707 replaces the existing neural network quantization algorithm with Wu's Color Quantizer, which offers better performance while maintaining comparable quality.

Old implementation (neural network via color_quant, with default sixel_fraction = 20) – average 189.5763999ms
New implementation (Wu - sRGB via quantette) – average 20.9199916ms

piper.yazi Plugin

With piper.yazi, you can use the output of any shell command as preview content. This eliminates the need to write a separate plugin for each command, making the use of custom previewers much more convenient.

Double Directory Size Calculation Speed

#2683 greatly improves directory computation performance by dividing the task into chunks and reusing existing threads. Directory sorting and file trashing will be observably twice as fast.

Run the benchmark script against a 10.16GB folder 5 times in release mode

Input Component Now Supports Password Mode

With #2675, a new obscure = true option is available

Truncate Long Items in the File List

#2754, #2759, and #2778 add truncation support for long filenames in the file list and archive preview, and display file extensions at the end, ensuring that even if a filename is truncated, you can still know what file type it is by its extension.

types.yazi Plugin

For a long time, Yazi lacked a type definition file, which made plugin development very painful. Now, it's here!

types.yazi provides type definitions for Yazi's Lua API, empowering an efficient plugin development experience.
Improved Built-In Previewers

    The video previewer now supports displaying embedded video covers, #2640
    The magick previewer will respect the user's image_alloc and image_bound settings, to limit its maximum resource usage, #2602, thanks to @ze0987
    The video previewer will respect the user's max_width setting, #2560, thanks to @ze0987

Improve Path Auto-Completion Results

The auto-completion results for interactive cd (key: g => <Space>) will now more closely match the user's input keywords.
