You-Get is a tiny command-line utility to download media contents
(videos, audios, images) from the Web, in case there is no other
handy way to do it.

You might want to use it:

 * You enjoyed something on the Internet, and just want to download them
   for your own pleasure.
 * You watch your favorite videos online from your computer, but you are
   prohibited from saving them. You feel that you have no control over
   your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.)
 * You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary
   JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your
   computer.
 * You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.

What you-get can do for you:

 * Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku,
   Niconico, and a bunch more.
 * Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more
   ads.
 * Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page.
 * Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.
