Zino Is Not OpenView.

Zino is an SNMP network based monitor that began its life at Uninett
in the mid 1990s. It was a home-grown system written in Tcl,
specifically to monitor the state of the routers of the Norwegian
national research network (NREN).  This is a re-implementation of
the server side of this system in Python.

Here's a quote about its features from the README file of the
original Tcl codebase and which is re-implemented here:

 o Trap-driven polling; receives and interprets traps.
 o Periodic status polling (by default low frequency).
 o A simplistic event handling system.
 o A simple SMTP-like client/server protocol.

Development of Zino 2.0 is fully sponsored by NORDUnet, on behalf
of all the nordic NRENs.
