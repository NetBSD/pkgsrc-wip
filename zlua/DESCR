z.lua is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It tracks your most used
directories, based on 'frecency'. After a short learning phase, z will take
you to the most 'frecent' directory that matches ALL of the regexes given
on the command line, in order.

For example, z foo bar would match /foo/bar but not /bar/foo.
