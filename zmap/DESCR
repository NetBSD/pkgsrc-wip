ZMap is a fast network scanner designed for Internet-wide network
surveys. On a typical desktop computer with a gigabit Ethernet
connection, ZMap is capable scanning the entire public IPv4 address
space in under 45 minutes.

While previous network tools have been designed to scan small
network segments, ZMap is specifically architected to scan the
entire address space.  It is built in a modular manner in order to
allow incorporation with other network survey tools.  ZMap operates
on GNU/Linux and supports TCP SYN and ICMP echo request scanning
out of the box.
