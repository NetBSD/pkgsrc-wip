Upstream upgrade notes (tweaked for pkgsrc):

    - The upgrade scripts will take longer than normal to run,
      especially if you have many events.

    - Your previous settings on the Options -> Paths tab have been
      moved into the file zmcustom.conf which is found under
      ${PKGSYSCONFDIR}/etc/zm/conf.d

    - Consider migrating your events folder from the former bind mount
      method to the new method under Options -> Storage

    - You should no longer have symbolic links in your webroot
      folder. This resolves a long standing security issue.

    - The Apache config file has changed.  Hand merge it and review
      your web setup.
