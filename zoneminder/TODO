1) for (stable final point releases):

   update to newer upstream

   validate that it actually runs

   push to pkgsrc

2) After updating to the current release

   File bugs upstream and add URLs

3) 1.32

   [I believe all items in this checklist have been dealt with.]

   Consider installing conf.d/zmpaths.conf setting the paths we set,
   because that seems necessary.

   Resolve zmc startup hang (zmdc expects zmc to exit, but it doesn't??).

   Resolve nph-zms vs zms, or decide it's an upstream choice that this
   package doesn't need to address.

   Add packages need for onvif to work.
