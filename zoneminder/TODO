* 1.36

  - Merge patches forward
  - Add missing dependencies
  - Compilation/PLIST

  - Add 1.34 release notes to COMMIT_MSG
  - Add 1.36 release notes to COMMIT_MSG
    + https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases/tag/1.36.33

  - Stray items from 1.32, not clear if they are present still or not

    + Consider installing conf.d/zmpaths.conf setting the paths we set,
      because that seems necessary.

    + Resolve zmc startup hang (zmdc expects zmc to exit, but it
      doesn't??).

    + Resolve nph-zms vs zms, or decide it's an upstream choice that
      this package doesn't need to address.

  - Test and find new issues

* After becoming current

   File bugs upstream and add URLs
