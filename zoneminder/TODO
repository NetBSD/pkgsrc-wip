1) for (some subset of final point releases):

   validate that it actually runs

   push to pkgsrc

   [I believe all items in this checklist have been dealt with.]

   Install conf.d/zmpaths.conf setting the paths we set, because that
   seems necessary.

   Resolve zmc startup hang (zmdc expects zmc to exit, but it doesn't??).

   Resolve nph-zms vs zms, and zms lockup on events view.
