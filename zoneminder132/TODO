  - Consider installing conf.d/zmpaths.conf setting the paths we set,
    because that seems necessary.

  - Resolve zmc startup hang.  zmdc.pl expects zmc to exit, but
    sometimes it doesn't.  Killing zmc if it remains running results
    in continuing and respawning and then it's ok.

  - Resolve nph-zms vs zms, or decide it's an upstream choice that this
    package doesn't need to address.
